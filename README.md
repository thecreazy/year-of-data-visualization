## Introduction

Yodv (Year of Data Visualization) is a "personal project" that helps me to:

1. Test graphs and data visualization libraries
2. Back writing UI code, trying to get back my pure FE skills
3. Wander through the free open data present on the web and understand how to represent it best
4. Have fun

### What doesn't mean?

1. If you don't like the data I show, sorry, at the bottom of the page there is the source, get mad at them
2. If it doesn't look good on your PC, I'm sorry, try writing to me or opening an issue on GitHub, I'll try to fix it, but I don't promise anything
3. It's a daily project, inevitably some days the data will be more interesting, others less so, if that's the case, wait until tomorrow

> I hope you are enjoying the project and happy Year of Data Visualization
