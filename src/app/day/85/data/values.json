If you want someone, then just call me up And remember where I'll be Sweet in barefeet You can find me where no one will be In the woods somewhere, in the night In the heart of a valley In the sweet north country If I'm not there, come to my house on Genesee",

    "song_lyrics": "Don't you understand what that means? It means quit lusting after your neighbor That's a heck of a life You get to love your children in front of you You get to love You ever talk to somebody \"I want a new life\" \"I don't love my wife anymore\" \"I don't love my kids anymore\" \"I'm missing out on life\" They're usually my age Does that sound like love? It's a life dominated with lust And for too long, they've been holding it off And finally, they just get weak and they say \"It doesn't matter anymore\" And the Spirit of God says \"I'll infuse you with dеsires for what you have And what's in front of you\" (Yeah, yеah, yeah) (Desires for what you have) So, as He works deep in your heart As you call out to Him and say \"I'm here, do it in me, Man\" \"Help me want what I got\" \"Help me love what's in front of me\" \"Help me want more of my wife and more of my friends\" \"And help me serve the city I live in and not wish it away and hope I can move\" \"Help me, God\" \"I wanna be a man of love, not a man of lust\" But you've gotta do that So I bring you to this verse and I'm done, I'm done Psalms, chapter eight And you know where I got this verse? This is gonna sound crazy to you, but I'm gonna tell you the absolute truth It's gonna make me sound so spiritual, so I'm looking forward to it I woke up this morning and God said, \"Check the Bible app\" I don't know if it was God, but it felt like God And I had the thought in my head, “Check the Bible app” I'm gonna speak to you from the verse of the day That means I don't have to do anything I don't have to look anywhere, I just get the verse of the day So I get to the verse of the day And here's the verse of the day, today, in the Bible app Look at this (That's cool) \"Look at the splendor of the skies Your creative genius glowing in the heavens When I gaze, when I gaze at Your moon and Your stars Mounted like jewels in their settings I know You are the fascinating artist who fashioned it all\" When I look up and I see such wonder and workmanship above \"I have to ask this question\" \"I've gotta ask this question\" Compared to all this cosmic glory \"Why would you ever bother with puny, mortal man?\" or be Ooh, don't get me started on it I could preach for another hour on infatuated Or be infatuated with Adam's son \"Why are you so infatuated with me?\" You're the star creator, You're the ocean maker (Yeah, yeah) You're the whale creator, you're the rhino designer Who, who are you? (Rhino designer) And then it goes on in verse five And it says \"Yet, what honor You have given to me Created only a little lower than Elohim\" Which is the name of Creator God, Artist God You wanna call God \"Artist\"? At some point tonight, before you go to bed, go, \"Yo, Elohim\" And He'll hear, \"You're the best Artist ever\" \"The little Elohim, crowned like kings and queens with glory and magnificence You have delighted, You have delegated to them Mastery over all You have made\" You have made me a partner with You I used to think my preaching was mostly about You And you're not gonna like this, but I'm gonna tell you the truth I've discovered my preaching is mostly about me",

I don't know anyone left who knows songs that I sing That's how the light gets in That's how the light gets in But, Daddy, I miss them I'm at the Roadrunner Café Probably runnin' away from the feelings today In the snow-capped mountains of the desert Daddy, I miss them I'm in the mountains Probably runnin' away, I've been meaning to say That there's nothing to do except know that this is How the light gets in By cracking, the light gets in It's how the light gets in That's how the light gets in That's how the light gets in Then you're golden, ah-ah-ah Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah Just another folk song, but anyway I try so hard, but that's okay It's how the light gets in It's how the light gets in It's how the light gets in",

Or will I get to that ten-year mark? Where I beat the extinction of telomeres? And if I do, will you be there with me, Father, Sister, Brother? Charlie, stop smoking Caroline, will you be with me? Will the baby be alright? Will I have one of mine? Can I handle it even if I do? It's said that my mind Is not fit, or so they said, to carry a child I guess I'll be fine It wasn't my idea, the cocktail of things that twists neurons inside But without them, I'd die They say there's irony in the music, it's a tragedy, I See nothing Greek in it Give me a mausoleum in Rhode Island with Dad, Grandma, Grandpa, and Dave Who hung himself real high In the National Park sky, it's a shame and I'm crying right now To get to you, save you, if I take my life Find your astral body, put it into my arms Give you two seconds to cry Take you home, I, I'll give you a blanket Your spirit can sit and watch TV by my side 'Cause, baby, I Ran through a time when I felt you were doing it I couldn't handle it, I was in Monaco I couldn't hear what they said on the telephone I had to sing for the prince in two hours Sat in the shower Gave myself two seconds to cry It's a shame that we die When I was fifteen, naked, next-door neighbors did a drive-by Pulled me up by my waist, long hair to the beach side I wanted to go out like you, swim with the fishes That he caught on Rhode Island beaches But, sometimes, it's just not your time Caroline,  what kind of  mother  was she to say I'd end up in institutions? All I wanted to do was kiss Aaron Greene and sit by The lake, twisting lime into the drinks that they made Have a babe at sixteen in the town I was born in, and die Aaron ended up dead and not me What the fuck's wrong in your head to send me away, never to come back? Exotic places and people don't take the place of being your child I give myself two seconds to cry Let it crash over me Like the waves in the sea Call me Aphrodite , as they bow down to me Sunbather, moon chaser , queen of empathy I give myself two seconds to breathe And go back to being a serene queen I just needed two seconds to be me",

You want more (Why?) You want more (Why?) 'Cause you want more Young thing on the downtown scene Rolling around at night Got things that have yet to be seen Like your rapper's delight A little party never hurt no one, that's why it's alright You want in, but you just can't win So you stay in the lights You're so Art Deco out on the floor Shining like gunmetal, cold and unsure Baby, you're so ghetto, you're looking to score When they all say hello, you try to ignore them 'Cause you want more (Why?) You want more (Why?) You want more (Why?) 'Cause you want more A little party never hurt no one So you stay out late A little party never hurt no one That's what your friends say You put your life out on the line You're crazy all the time Put your life out on the line You're crazy all the time You're so Art Deco out on the floor Shining like gunmetal, cold and unsure Baby, you're so ghetto, you're looking to score When they all say hello, you try to ignore them 'Cause you want more (Why?) You want more (Why?) You want more (Why?) 'Cause you want more A little party never hurt no one Not you and me A little party never hurt no one We were born to be free",

And what about all their crowns they wear In hair so long like mine? And what about all their wishes Wrapped up like garland roses Around their little heads? I said a prayer for a third time I'd trade it all for a stairway to Heaven (A stairway, stairway to Heaven) I'd take my time for the climb up to the top of it (A stairway) I'd trade the fame and the fortune and the legend (Stairway) I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask Him one question I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask Him one question I was at Coachella leanin' on your shoulder Watchin' your husband swing and shine I'd say he was hella cool to win them over Critics can be so mean sometimes He was on his knees and I thought he was breakin' 'em down With his words and his voice divine Doesn't take a genius to know what you've got goin' And to not wanna lose it 'cause they lost their minds What about all these children And all their children's children? And why am I even wonderin' that today? Maybe my contribution could be as small as hoping That words could turn to birds And birds would send my thoughts your way I'd trade it all for a stairway to Heaven (A stairway, stairway to Heaven) I'd take my time for the climb up to the top of it (A stairway) I'd trade the fame and the fortune and the legend (Stairway) I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask Him one question I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask Him one question A stairway, stairway to Heaven (Na-na, na-na) A stairway Got a million things I wanna say Like, what's it all for? Will it be okay? (A stairway, stairway to Heaven) Million things I wanna say Like, what's it all for?

I've been thinkin' it's just someone else's job to care Who am I to wanna try? But Change is a powerful thing, people are powerful beings Tryin' to find the power in me to be faithful Change is a powerful thing, I feel it comin' in me Maybe by the time summer's done I'll be able to be honest, capable Of holdin' you in my arms without lettin' you fall When I don't feel beautiful or stable Maybe it's enough to just be where we are because Every time that we run, we don't know what it's from Now we finally slow down, we feel close to it There's a change gonna come, I don't know where or when But whenever it does, we'll be here for it There's somethin' in the wind, I can feel it blowin' in It's comin' in softly on the wings of a song There's somethin' in the water, I can taste it turnin' sour It's bitter, I'm coughing, but now it's in my blood Lately, I've been thinkin' it's just someone else's job to care Who am I to sympathize when no one gave a damn? I've been thinkin' it's just someone else's job to care 'Cause who am I to wanna try? But Change is a powerful thing, people are powerful beings Tryin' to find the power in me to be faithful Change is a powerful thing, I feel it comin' in me Maybe by the time summer's done I'll be able to be honest, capable Of holdin' you in my arms without letting you fall When I don't feel beautiful or stable Maybe it's enough to just be where we are, because Every time that we run, we don't know what it's from Now we finally slow down, we feel close to it There's a change gonna come, I don't know where or when But whenever it does, we'll be here for it Mmm Yeah, whenever it does, we'll be here for it Mmm Whenever it does, we'll be here for it",

Haven't seen you 'round here lately All of the guys tell me lies, but you don't You just crack another beer And pretend that you're still here This is how to disappear This is how to disappear Joe met me down at the training yard Cuts on his face 'cause he fought too hard I know he's in over his head But I love that man like nobody can He moves mountains and pounds them to ground again I watched the guys getting high as they fight For the things that they hold dear To forget the things they fear This is how to disappear This is how to disappear  Now it's been years since I left New York I've got a kid and two cats in the yard The California sun and the movie stars I watch the skies getting light as I write As I think about those years As I whisper in your ear I'm always going to be right here No one's going anywhere",

Love you more than those bitches before Say you'll remember, say you'll remember Baby, oh, I will love you 'til the end of time Big dreams, gangster Said I had to leave to start my life over You were like, \"No, please, stay here\" We don't need no money we can make it all work But I headed out on Sunday, said, I'd come home Monday You stayed up waitin', anticipatin', and pacin' But I was chasing paper \"Caught up in the game\" that was the last you heard, oh, baby I will love you 'til the end of time I would wait a million years Promise you'll remember that you're mine Baby, can you see through the tears? Love you more than those bitches before Say you'll remember, say you'll remember Baby, oh, I will love you 'til the end of time I will love you 'til the end of time (You have always worn your flaws upon your sleeve) I would wait a million years (And I have always buried them deep beneath the ground) Baby, can you see through the tears? (You have always worn your flaws upon your sleeve) Baby, oh (And I have always buried them deep beneath the ground)",

LA, I picked San Francisco because the man who doesn't love me lives there LA, I'm pathetic, but so are you, can I come home now? Daughter to no one, table for one Party of thousands of people I don't know at Delilah where my ex-husband works I'm sick of this, but can I come home now? Mother to no one, private jet for one Back home to the Tudor house that borned a thousand murder plots Hancock Park, it's treated me very badly, I'm resentful The witch on the corner, the neighbor nobody wanted The reason for Garcetti's extra security LA, I know I'm bad, but I have nowhere else to go , can I come home now? I never had a mother, will you let me make the sun my own for now, and the ocean my son? I'm quite good at tending to things despite my upbringing, can I raise your mountains? I promise to keep them greener, make them my daughters Teach them about fire, warn them about water I'm lonely, LA, can I come home now? I left my city for San Francisco And I'm writing from the Golden Gate Bridge But it's not going as I planned I took a free ride off a billionaire and brought my typewriter And promised myself that I would stay, but It's just not going the way that I thought It's not that I feel different, and I don't mind that it's not hot It's just that I belong to no one, which means there's only one place for me The city not quite awake, the city not quite asleep The city that's still deciding how good it can be And also I can't sleep without you No one's ever really held me like you Not quite tightly, but certainly, I feel your body next to me Smoking next to me Vaping lightly next to me And I love that you love the neon lights like me Orange in the distance We both love that And I love that we have that in common Also, neither one of us can go back to New York For you are unmoving As for me, it won't be my city again until I'm dead Fuck the New York Post LA, who am I to need you when I've needed so much, asked for so much? And what I've been given, I'm not sure yet I may never know that either until I'm dead For now, though, what I do know Is although I don't deserve you Not you at your best and your splendor With towering eucalyptus trees that sway in my dominion Not you at your worst Totally on fire, unlivable, unbreathable, I need you You see, I have no mother And you do A continental shelf A larger piece of land from where you came And I? I'm an orphan A little seashell that rests upon your native shores One of many, for sure But because of that, I surely must love you closely to the most of anyone For that reason, let me love you Don't mind my desperation Let me hold you, not just for vacation But for real and for forever Make it real life Let me be a real wife to you Girlfriend, lover, mother, friend I adore you Don't be put off by my quick-wordedness I'm generally quite quiet Quite a meditator, actually I'll do very well down by Paramhansa Yogananda's realization center, I'm sure I promise you'll barely even notice me Unless you want to notice me Unless you prefer a rambunctious child In which case, I can turn it on too I'm quite good on the stage as you may know You might have heard of me So either way, I'll fit in just fine So just love me by doing nothing And perhaps, by not shaking the county line I'm yours if you'll have me But regardless, you're mine",

My life is my poetry, my love making is my legacy! My thoughts are about nothing, and beautiful, and for free You see, the things that can’t be bought can’t be evaluated, and that makes them beyond human reach Untouchable, safe, otherworldy Unable to be deciphered or metabolized Something metaphysical , like a view of the sea on a summer day on the most perfect winding road taken in from the car window A thing perfect, and ready to become a part of the texture of the fabric of something more ethereal Like Mount Olympus, where Zeus sent Athena and the rest of the immortals to play",

    "song_lyrics": "I took a flying lesson on my 33rd birthday, instead of calling you Or parking on the block where our old place used to be Genesee, genesee, genesee Pathetic, I know - but sometimes I still like to park on that street, And have lunch in the car just to feel close to you I was once in love with my life here, In that studio apartment with you Little yellow flowers on the tops of trees as our only view, Out of the only window, Big enough for me to see our future through But it turned out I was the only one who could see it Stupid apartment complex Terrible you You, who I wait for You, you, you Like a broken record stuck on loop So that day, on my birthday, I thought \"Something has to change\" You can’t always be about waiting for you Don’t tell anyone , but part of my reasoning for taking the flight class, was this idea that if I could become my own navigator The captain of the sky, That perhaps I could stop looking for direction from you Well, what started off as an idea on a whim, Has turned into something more Too shy to explain to the owners that my first lesson was just a one-time thing I’ve continued to go to classes each week At the precious little strip off Santa Monica and Bundy And everything was going fine We were starting with dips and loops and then something terrible happened During my fourth lesson in the sky My instructor, younger than I, but as tough as you Instructed me to do a simple maneuverer It’s not that I didn’t do it, But I was slow to lean the sports cruiser into a right hand upward turn Scared, scared that I would lose control of the plane Not tactfully and not gently The instructor shook his head, and without looking at me said “You don’t trust yourself” I was horrified Feeling as though I’d somehow been found out Like he knew me How weak I was Of course, he was only talking about my ability as a pilot in the sky But I knew it was meant for me to hear those words For me, they held a deeper meaning I didn’t trust myself Not just 25,000 feet above the coast of Malibu But with anything And I didn’t trust you I could’ve said something but I was quiet Because pilots aren’t like poets They don’t make metaphors between life and the sky In the midst of this mid-life, meltdown, navigational exercise in self-examination, I also decided to do something else I always wanted to do Take sailing lessons in the vibrant bay of Marina del Rey I signed up for the class as \" Elizabeth Grant \", And nobody blinked an eye So, why was I so sure that when I walked into the tiny shack on Valley Way, someone would say “You’re not a captain of a ship, or a master of the sky!” No, the fisherman didn’t care, and so neither did I And for a brief moment, I felt more myself than ever before Letting the self proclaimed drunkard captain’s lessons wash over me like the foamy tops of the sea Midway through my forehead burned, and my hands raw from driving The captain told me the most important thing I’d need to know on the sea “Never run the ship into irons” That’s nautical terms for not sailing the boat directly into the wind In order to do that though, you have to know where the wind is coming from And you might not have time to look up to the mast, Or up further to the weathervane So you have to feel where the wind is coming from On your cheeks, and by the tips of the white waves from which direction they’re rolling To do this, he gave me an exercise He told me to close my eyes, and asked me to feel on my neck which way the wind was blowing I already knew I was going to get it wrong “The wind is coming from everywhere, I feel it all over” I told him “No”, he said “the wind is coming from the left. The portside” I sat waiting for him to tell me “You don’t trust yourself” But he didn’t, so I said it for him “I don’t trust myself” He laughed gentler than the pilot, but still not realising that my failure in the exercise was hitting me at a much deeper level “It’s not that you don’t trust yourself” he said. “it’s simply that you’re not a captain. It isn’t what you do” Then he told me he wanted me to practise everyday so I would get better “Which grocery store do you go to?” he asked “To the Ralphs in the Palisades” I replied “Okay. When you’re in the Ralphs in the Palisades, I want you, as you're walking from your car to the store, To close your eyes, and feel which way the wind is blowing Now, I don’t want you to look like a crazy person crouching in the middle of the parking lot, but everywhere you go, I want you to try and find which way the wind is coming in from And then, determine if it’s from the port or starboard side, So when you’re back on the boat you have a better sense of it” I thought his advice was adorable I could already picture myself in the parking lot, Squinting my eyes with perfect housewives looking on I could picture myself growing a better sense of which way the wind was blowing And as I did, a tiny bit of deeper trust also began to grow within myself I thought of mentioning it, but I didn’t Because captain’s aren’t like poets They don’t make metaphors between sea and sky And as I thought that to myself, I realized that’s why I write All of this circumnavigating the earth, Was to get back to my life Six trips to the moon for my poetry to arise I’m not a captain, I’m not a pilot I write! I write",

    "song_lyrics": "Last year, when I wrote you my last letter the beginning of my future poetry I acknowledged who you really were for the first time I didn’t call you by any other name I let you know that I knew the true nature of your heart That it was evil, and that it convinced me that darkness was real that the devil is a real devil and that monsters don’t always know that they’re monster s But projection is an amazing thing after you left and burnt the house down you tried to convince me that it was I who was holding the matches You told me that I didn’t know who I was, but I do I love rose gardens I plant violets every time someone leaves me I love the great sequoias of Yosemite And if you asked my sister to describe the first thing she thinks of when she thinks of me she would say \"camp fire smoke\" I’m gentle I’m funny when I’m drunk But I haven’t been drunk for 14 years I go on trips with my friends to the beach who don’t know that I’m crazy I can do that I can do anything Even leave you Because my bedroom is a sacred place now that there are children at the end of my bed telling me stories about the friends that they pretend to hate, that they will make up with later And there are fresh cut flowers that I grew myself in vases from the yard on nightstands, hand carved by old pals from Big Sur And the longer I stay here the more I am sure But the more I step into becoming a poet The less I will fall into being with you The more I step into my poetry The less I will fall into being with you The more I step into my poetry The less I will fall into bed with you",

    "song_lyrics": "Paradise is very fragile, and it seems like it's only getting worse Down here in Florida We’re fighting red toxic tides Mass of fish kills Not to mention hurricanes and rising sea levels Back in Los Angeles, things aren't looking much better My treehouse that'd been standing for 80 years succumbed to the woolsy fire Who would’ve thought that this year at 33 You would've been taken out from under me After all those years? Built from the ground up, by hand, by your very first owner Quiet World War One, aviation pilot I tried to save you but the German Shepherd seemed more important Paradise is very fragile, and it seems like it's only getting worse Our leader is a megalomaniac , And we've seen that before But never 'cause it was what the country deserved My friends tell me to stop calling 911 on the culture, but it's either that or I 5150 myself They don't understand I'm a dreamer And I had big dreams for the country Not for what it could do, but how it could feel How it could think, how it could dream I know Who am I to dream for you? It’s just that in my own mind I was born with a little bit of paradise I was lucky in that way Not like my husband Who was born and raised in hell I always had something gentle to give All of me, in fact It’s one of the beautiful things about me It's one of the beautiful things about nature But lately I’ve been thinking that I wish Someone had told me when I was younger More about the inhabitants that thrive off of paradise That should they take too much, There would be nothing left to give Not everyone's nature is golden and green And you can't fight what's in your nature I got to thinking about it as We were fighting the fires in Agora But I’m tired of fighting you Paradise is very fragile, and it's only getting worse And every time I think of that, I think about the curse bestowed upon Eve, that fateful eve, She took that bite of fruit from that fruitful tree And this summer night, you in front of me, Makes me contemplate the origins of good and evil Because you take and you take and you take and you take, But you taste like the beach and a kiss Candy from my eyes In my veins you run citrus Watercolor images of serpents on orange trees Arise in my midst Kundalini , you breathe me I could do this forever But my heart is very fragile, and I have nothing left to give",

    "song_lyrics": "Stay on your path Sylvia Plath don't fall away like all the others Don't take all your secrets alone to your watery grave about lovers and  - The secrets you keep will keep you in deep like Amy and - And brother And all of the people you meet on the street will reiterate lies that they uttered Leave me in peace, I cry In the middle of the night On a slow boat bound for Catalina for no reason Tiny drops of perspiration dot my forehead could be mistaken for dew drops if this were photo season But alas this is a real life - and it's been a real fight just to stop my mind from committing treason Why you ask? Because she told the townspeople I was crazy, and the lies, they started to believe them But anyways - that's all over now I've moved on, gone scorched earth And now I'm left wondering where to go from here To Sonoma where the fires have just left? South Dakota? Would standing in front of Mount Rushmore feel like the Great American homecoming I never had? Would the magnitude of the scale of the sculptures take the place of the warm embrace I've never got? Or should I just be here now Bare feet on linoleum Slicing vegetables onto water that I will later turn into stew People love my stories People love visions",
