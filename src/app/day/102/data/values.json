And there he goes, so perfectly The kind of flawless I wish I could be She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar The only thing that keeps me wishin' on a wishing star He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do So I'll drive home alone as I turn off the light I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight 'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do He's the time taken up, but there's never enough And he's all that I need to fall into Drew looks at me I fake a smile, so he won't see",

I don't know what to think\" He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said \"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone I love you and that's all I really know I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress It's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'\" Oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh 'Cause we were both young when I first saw you",

You belong with me, you belong with me Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself Hey, isn't this easy? And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down You say you're fine, I know you better than that Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that? She wears high heels, I wear sneakers She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find That what you're looking for has been here the whole time If you could see that I'm the one who understands you Been here all along, so why can't you see? You belong with me Standing by and waiting at your back door All this time, how could you not know, baby? You belong with me, you belong with me Oh, I remember you driving to my house In the middle of the night I'm the one who makes you laugh When you know you're 'bout to cry And I know your favorite songs And you tell me 'bout your dreams Think I know where you belong Think I know it's with me Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you Been here all along, so why can't you see?

Please, tell me 'Cause one second, it was perfect Now, you're halfway out the door And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all And you flashback to when he said, \"Forever and always\" Oh, and it rains in your bedroom Everything is wrong It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone 'Cause I was there when you said, \"Forever and always\" Was I out of line? Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide Like a scared little boy? I looked into your eyes Thought I knew you for a minute, now, I'm not so sure So here's to everything coming down to nothing Here's to silence that cuts me to the core Where is this going?

I don't know what to think\" He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said \"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone I love you and that's all I really know I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'\" Oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh 'Cause we were both young when I first saw you",

You put your arm around me for the first time You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter You are the best thing that's ever been mine Flash forward and we're takin' on the world together And there's a drawer of my things at your place You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes But we got bills to pay We got nothing figured out When it was hard to take Yes, yes, this is what I thought about Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water? You put your arm around me for the first time You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter You are the best thing that's ever been mine Do you remember all the city lights on the water? You saw me start to believe for the first time You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter You are the best thing that's ever been mine Oh-oh, oh-oh And I remember that fight, 2:30AM As everything was slipping right out of our hands I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street Braced myself for the goodbye 'Cause that's all I've ever known Then you took me by surprise You said, \"I'll never leave you alone\" You said, \"I remember how we felt sitting by the water And every time I look at you, it's like the first time I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter She is the best thing that's ever been mine\" Hold on, make it last Hold on, never turn back (Hold on) You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter (Make it last) (Hold on) You are the best thing that's ever been mine (Hold on) Yes, yes, do you believe it? (Hold on) Yes, yes, we're gonna make it now (Hold on) Yes, yes, I can see it Yes, yes, I can see it now",

I haven't seen them in a while You've been good, busier than ever We small talk, work and the weather Your guard is up and I know why Because the last time you saw me Is still burned in the back of your mind You gave me roses and I left them there to die So this is me swallowing my pride Standin' in front of you sayin', \"I'm sorry for that night\" And I go back to December all the time It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine I go back to December, turn around and make it alright I go back to December all the time These days, I haven't been sleeping Stayin' up, playing back myself leavin' When your birthday passed and I didn't call Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times I watched you laughing from the passenger side And realized I loved you in the fall And then the cold came, the dark days When fear crept into my mind You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye So this is me swallowing my pride Standin' in front of you, sayin', \"I'm sorry for that night\" And I go back to December all the time It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind I go back to December all the time I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile So good to me, so right And how you held me in your arms that September night The first time you ever saw me cry Maybe this is wishful thinkin' Probably mindless dreaming But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't So, if the chain is on your door, I understand But this is me swallowing my pride Standin' in front of you, sayin', \"I'm sorry for that night\" And I go back to December It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine I go back to December, turn around and make it alright I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind I go back to December all the time All the time",

Don't say yes, run away now I'll meet you when you're out Of the church, at the back door Don't wait or say a single vow You need to hear me out And they said, \"Speak now\" Don't say yes, run away now (Run away now) I'll meet you when you're out Of the church, at the back door Don't wait or say a single vow (Say a single vow) Your time is running out And they said, \"Speak now\" Ooh (Run away now), la Ooh (Say a single vow), ooh I hear the preacher say \"Speak now or forever hold your peace\" There's the silence, there's my last chance I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me Horrified looks from everyone in the room But I'm only lookin' at you I am not the kind of girl Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion But you are not the kind of boy Who should be marrying the wrong girl, haha So, don't say yes, run away now I'll meet you when you're out Of the church, at the back door Don't wait or say a single vow You need to hear me out They said, \"Speak now\" And you say, \"Let's run away now (Run away now) I'll meet you when I'm out Of my tux, at the back door Baby, I didn't say my vows (Say a single vow) So glad you were around When they said, 'Speak now'",

The girl in the dress cried the whole way home I should've known Well, maybe it's me And my blind optimism to blame Or maybe it's you and your sick need To give love and take it away And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors Who don't understand And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said \"Run as fast as you can\" Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone Don't you think I was too young to be messed with? The girl in the dress cried the whole way home Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong Don't you think nineteen's too young To be played by your dark, twisted games when I loved you so? I should've known You are an expert at sorry and keeping lines blurry Never impressed by me acing your tests All the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes 'Cause you burned them out But I took your matches before fire could catch me So don't look now I'm shining like fireworks over your sad empty town Oh, oh Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone Don't you think I was too young to be messed with? The girl in the dress cried the whole way home I see it all now that you're gone Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?

I wonder 'til I'm wide awake And now, I'm pacing back and forth Wishing you were at my door I'd open up and you would say \"Hey, it was enchanting to meet you\" All I know is I was enchanted to meet you This night is sparklin', don't you let it go I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew This night is flawless, don't you let it go I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew I was enchanted to meet you This is me praying that This was the very first page Not where the storyline ends My thoughts will echo your name Until I see you again These are the words I held back As I was leaving too soon I was enchanted to meet you Please, don't be in love with someone else Please, don't have somebody waiting on you Please, don't be in love with someone else (Ooh) Please, don't have somebody waiting on you (Ooh, oh) This night is sparklin', don't you let it go I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew This night is flawless (Please, don't be in love with someone else) Don't you let it go I'm wonderstruck (Please, don't have somebody waiting on you) Dancing around all alone I'll spend forever (Please, don't be in love with someone else) Wonderin' if you knew I was enchanted to meet you Please, don't be in love with someone else Please, don't have somebody waiting on you",

I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey You might have him, but I always get the last word Woah, woah-ah-oh She's not a saint and she's not what you think She's an actress, woah (She deserved it) She's better known for the things that she does On the mattress, woah Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys On the playground won't make you many friends She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind There is nothing I do better than revenge Do you still feel like you know what you're doing? 'Cause I don't think you do, oh (No, no, no, no) Do you still feel like you know what you're doing? (No) I don't think you do, I don't think you do Let's hear the applause (Come on, come on) Come on, show me how much better you are (So much better, yeah?) See, you deserve some applause 'Cause you're so much better She took him faster than you could say \"Sabotage",

It's alright, just wait and see Your string of lights is still bright to me, oh Who you are is not where you've been You're still an innocent You're still an innocent Did some things you can't speak of But at night, you live it all again You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now If only you had seen what you know now then Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catching days? When everything out of reach Someone bigger brought down to you Wasn't it beautiful running wild 'til you fell asleep Before the monsters caught up to you? It's alright, just wait and see Your string of lights is still bright to me, oh Who you are is not where you've been You're still an innocent It's okay, life is a tough crowd Thirty-two and still growing up now Who you are is not what you did You're still an innocent Time turns flames to embers You'll have new Septembers Every one of us has messed up, too, ooh Minds change like the weather I hope you remember Today is never too late to be brand new, oh It's alright, just wait and see Your string of lights is still bright to me, oh Who you are is not where you've been You're still an innocent It's okay, life is a tough crowd Thirty-two and still growing up now Who you are is not what you did You're still an innocent You're still an innocent Lost your balance on a tightrope, oh It's never too late to get it back",

Promise me this That you'll stand by me forever But if, God forbid, fate should step in And force us into a goodbye If you have children some day When they point to the pictures Please, tell 'em my name Tell 'em how the crowds went wild Tell 'em how I hope they shine Long live the walls we crashed through I had the time of my life with you Long, long live the walls we crashed through How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you And I was screaming, \"Long live all the magic we made\" And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid Singing, \"Long live all the mountains we moved\" I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you And long, long live that look on your face And bring on all the pretenders One day, we will be remembered",

You put your arm around me for the first time You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter You are the best thing that's ever been mine Flash forward and we're taking on the world together And there's a drawer of my things at your place You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes But we got bills to pay We got nothing figured out When it was hard to take Yes, yes, this is what I thought about Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water? You put your arm around me for the first time You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter You are the best thing that's ever been mine Do you remember all the city lights on the water? You saw me start to believe for the first time You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter You are the best thing that's ever been mine Oh-oh, oh And I remember that fight, 2:30 AM As everything was slipping right out of our hands I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street Braced myself for the goodbye 'Cause it's all I've ever known Then you took me by surprise You said, \"I'll never leave you alone\" (Oh) You said, \"I remember how we felt sitting by the water And every time I look at you, it's like the first time I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter She is the best thing that's ever been mine\" Hold on, make it last Hold on, never turn back (Hold on) You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter (Hold on) You are the best thing that's ever been mine Do you believe it?

I haven't seen them in a while You've been good, busier than ever We small talk, work and the weather Your guard is up and I know why Because the last time you saw me Is still burned in the back of your mind You gave me roses and I left them there to die So, this is me swallowing my pride Standin' in front of you sayin', \"I'm sorry for that night\" And I go back to December all the time It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine I go back to December, turn around and make it alright I go back to December all the time These days, I haven't been sleeping Stayin' up, playing back myself leavin' When your birthday passed and I didn't call Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times I watched you laughin' from the passenger side And realized I loved you in the fall And then the cold came, the dark days When fear crept into my mind You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye So, this is me swallowing my pride Standin' in front of you, sayin', \"I'm sorry for that night\" And I go back to December all the time It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind I go back to December all the time I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile So good to me, so right And how you held me in your arms that September night The first time you ever saw me cry Maybe this is wishful thinkin' Probably mindless dreaming But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't So, if the chain is on your door, I understand But this is me swallowing my pride Standin' in front of you, sayin', \"I'm sorry for that night\" And I go back to December It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine I go back to December, turn around and make it alright I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind I go back to December all the time All the time",

Don't say yes, run away now I'll meet you when you're out Of the church, at the back door Don't wait or say a single vow You need to hear me out And they said, \"Speak now\" Don't say yes, run away now (Run away now) I'll meet you when you're out Of the church, at the back door Don't wait or say a single vow (Say a single vow) Your time is running out And they said, \"Speak now\" Ooh (Run away now), la Ooh (Say a single vow), ooh I hear the preacher say \"Speak now or forever hold your peace\" There's the silence, there's my last chance I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me Horrified looks from everyone in the room But I'm only lookin' at you I am not the kind of girl Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion But you are not the kind of boy Who should be marrying the wrong girl, haha So, don't say yes, run away now I'll meet you when you're out Of the church, at the back door Don't wait or say a single vow You need to hear me out They said, \"Speak now\" And you say, \"Let's run away now (Run away now) I'll meet you when I'm out Of my tux, at the back door Baby, I didn't say my vows (Say a single vow) So glad you were around When they said, 'Speak now'",

The girl in the dress cried the whole way home I shoulda known Well, maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame Or maybe it's you and your sick need To give love and take it away And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors Who don't understand And I'll look back and regret how I ignored when they said \"Run as fast as you can\" Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone Don't you think I was too young to be messed with? The girl in the dress cried the whole way home Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong Don't you think nineteen's too young to be played by Your dark, twisted games when I loved you so? I shoulda known  You are an expert at \"Sorry\" and keepin' lines blurry Never impressed by me acing your tests All the girls that you run dry have tired, lifeless eyes 'Cause you burned them out But I took your matches before fire could catch me So don't look now I'm shining like fireworks over your sad, empty town Oh Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone Don't you think I was too young to be messed with? The girl in the dress cried the whole way home I see it all now that you're gone Don't you think I was too young to be messed with? The girl in the dress wrote you a song You shoulda known You shoulda known Don't you think I was too young? You shoulda known",

Yeah I don't know what to say since thе twist of fate When it all broke down And thе story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now Next chapter How'd we end up this way? See me nervously pulling at my clothes and tryin’ to look busy And you're doin' your best to avoid me I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us How I was losin' my mind when I saw you here But you held your pride like you should've held me Oh, I'm scared to see the ending Why are we pretending this is nothin'? I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how I've never heard silence quite this loud Now I'm standin' alone in a crowded room And we're not speakin' And I'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you Like it's killin' me? Yeah I don't know what to say since the twist of fate When it all broke down And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now This is looking like a contest Of who can act like they care less But I liked it better when you were on my side The battle's in your hands now But I would lay my armor down If you said you'd rather love than fight So many things that you wish I knew But the story of us might be ending soon Now I'm standin' alone in a crowded room And we're not speakin' And I'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you Like it's killin' me? Yeah And I don't know what to say since the twist of fate When it all broke down And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now And we're not speakin' And I'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you Like it's killin' me?

I wonder 'til I'm wide awake And now, I'm pacing back and forth Wishing you were at my door I'd open up and you would say \"Hey, it was enchanting to meet you\" All I know is I was enchanted to meet you This night is sparklin', don't you let it go I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew This night is flawless, don't you let it go I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew I was enchanted to meet you This is me praying that This was the very first page Not where the storyline ends My thoughts will echo your name Until I see you again These are the words I held back As I was leaving too soon I was enchanted to meet you Please, don't be in love with someone else Please, don't have somebody waitin' on you Please, don't be in love with someone else (Ooh) Please, don't have somebody waitin' on you (Oh-oh) This night is sparklin', don't you let it go I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew This night is flawless (Please, don't be in love with someone else) Don't you let it go I'm wonderstruck (Please, don't have somebody waitin' on you) Dancing around all alone I'll spend forever (Please, don't be in love with someone else) Wonderin' if you knew I was enchanted to meet you Please, don't be in love with someone else Please, don't have somebody waitin' on you",

Away I do recall now, the smell of the rain Fresh on the pavement, I ran off the plane That July ninth, the beat of your heart It jumps through your shirt, I can still feel your arms But now I'll go Sit on the floor wearin' your clothes All that I know is I don't know How to be somethin' you miss I never thought we'd have a last kiss I never imagined we'd end like this Your name, forever the name on my lips I do remember the swing of your step The life of the party, you're showin' off again And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in I'm not much for dancin', but for you, I did Because I love your handshake meetin' my father I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions And I'll go Sit on the floor wearin' your clothes All that I know is I don't know How to be somethin' you miss I never thought we'd have a last kiss I never imagined we'd end like this Your name, forever the name on my lips, mmm So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe And I'll keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are Hope it's nice where you are And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day And something reminds you you wish you had stayed You can plan for a change in the weather and time But I never planned on you changing your mind So I'll go Sit on the floor wearin' your clothes All that I know is I don't know How to be somethin' you miss I never thought we'd have a last kiss I never imagined we'd end like this Your name, forever the name on my lips Just like our last kiss Forever the name on my lips Forever the name on my lips Just like our last",

Promise me this That you'll stand by me forever But if, God forbid, fate should step in And force us into a goodbye If you have children some day When they point to the pictures Please, tell 'em my name Tell 'em how the crowds went wild Tell 'em how I hope they shine Long live the walls we crashed through I had the time of my life with you Long, long live the walls we crashed through How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you And I was screaming, \"Long live all the magic we made\" And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid Singing, \"Long live all the mountains we moved\" I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you And long, long live that look on your face And bring on all the pretenders One day, we will be remembered",

And what do you do When the one who means the most to you Is the one who didn't show? You should've been here And I would've been so happy And it was like slow motion Standing there in my party dress In red lipstick With no one to impress And they're all standing around me, singing \"Happy birthday to you\" But there was one thing missing And that was the moment I knew Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I knew Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh You called me later And said, \"I'm sorry I didn't make it\" And I said, \"I'm sorry, too\" And that was the moment I knew",

And what do you do When the one who means the most to you Is the one who didn't show? You should've been here And I would've been so happy And it was like slow motion Standing there in my party dress In red lipstick With no one to impress And they're all standin' around me, singin' \"Happy birthday to you\" But there was one thing missin' And that was the moment I knew (Oh) Oh, I knew (Oh) You called me later And said, \"I'm sorry I didn't make it\" And I said, \"I'm sorry too\" And that was the moment I knew",

And will you still want me When I'm nothing new? How long will it be cute, all this cryin' in my room? When you can't blame it on my youth And roll your eyes with affection And my cheeks are growing tired From turning red and faking smiles Are we only biding time 'til I lose your attention? And someone else lights up the room (Ah) People love an ingénue (Ah) I've had (I've had) too much to drink tonight How did I go from growin' up to breaking down? And I wake up (Wake up) in the middle of the night It's like I can feel time movin' How can a person know everything at eighteen But nothing at twenty-two? And will you still want me When I'm nothing new? I know someday I'm gonna meet her, it's a fever dream The kind of radiance you only have at  seventeen She'll know the way and then she'll say she got the map from me I'll say I'm happy for her , then I'll cry myself to sleep Oh, woah, oh (Oh) Oh, woah, oh, woah, oh (Oh) I've had (I've had) too much to drink tonight But I wonder if they'll miss me once they drive me out I wake up (Wake up) in the middle of the night And I can feel time moving How can a person know everything at eighteen But nothing at twenty-two? And will you still want me Will you still want me Will you still want me When I'm nothing new?",

I don't have to be your shrink to know that you'll never be happy And I bet you think about me I bet you think about me, yes I bet you think about me Oh, block it all out The voices so loud, sayin' \"Why did you let her go?\" Does it make you feel sad That the love that you're lookin' for Is the love that you had? Now you're out in the world, searchin' for your soul Scared not to be hip, scared to get old Chasing make-believe status, last time you felt free Was when none of that shit mattered 'cause you were with me But now that we're done and it's over I bet it's hard to believe But it turned out I'm harder to forget than I was to leave And, yeah , I bet you think about me I bet you think about me, yes I bet you think about me I bet you think about me when you're out At your cool indie music concerts every week I bet you think about me in your house With your organic shoes and your million-dollar couch I bet you think about me when you say \"Oh my god, she's insane, she wrote a song about me\" I bet you think about me",

A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you Not weepin' in a party bathroom Some actress askin' me what happened, you That's what happened, you You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come And he said, \"It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one\" Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone But you keep my old scarf from that very first week 'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me You can't get rid of it 'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah 'Cause there we are again when I loved you so Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known It was rare, I was there I remember it all too well Wind in my hair, you were there You remember it all Down the stairs, you were there You remember it all It was rare, I was there I remember it all too well And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes \"I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age\" From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue? Just between us, did the love affair maim you too? 'Cause in this city's barren cold I still remember the first fall of snow And how it glistened as it fell I remember it all too well Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well? Just between us, do you remember it all too well? Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there) Down the stairs, I was there, I was there Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there It was rare, you remember it all too well Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh) Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there) Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there It was rare, you remember it (All too well) Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there Down the stairs, I was there, I was there Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there It was rare, you remember it Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there Down the stairs, I was there, I was there Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there It was rare, you remember it",

Rumors fly And I know you heard about me So, hey, let's be friends I'm dying to see how this one ends Grab your passport and my hand I can make the bad guys good for a weekend So it's gonna be forever Or it's gonna go down in flames? You can tell me when it's over, mm If the high was worth the pain Got a long list of ex-lovers They'll tell you I'm insane 'Cause you know I love the players And you love the game 'Cause we're young and we're reckless We'll take this way too far It'll leave you breathless, mm Or with a nasty scar Got a long list of ex-lovers They'll tell you I'm insane But I've got a blank space, baby And I'll write your name Cherry lips, crystal skies I could show you incredible things Stolen kisses, pretty lies You're the king, baby, I'm your queen Find out what you want Be that girl for a month Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh, no Screaming, crying, perfect storms I can make all the tables turn Rose garden filled with thorns Keep you second guessing, like \"Oh, my God, who is she?\" I get drunk on jealousy But you'll come back each time you leave 'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream So it's gonna be forever Or it's gonna go down in flames? You can tell me when it's over, mm If the high was worth the pain Got a long list of ex-lovers They'll tell you I'm insane 'Cause you know I love the players And you love the game 'Cause we're young and we're reckless (Oh) We'll take this way too far It'll leave you breathless (Oh-oh), mm Or with a nasty scar Got a long list of ex-lovers They'll tell you I'm insane (Insane) But I've got a blank space, baby And I'll write your name Boys only want love if it's torture Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya Boys only want love if it's torture Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya So it's gonna be forever Or it's gonna go down in flames? You can tell me when it's over (Over), mm If the high was worth the pain Got a long list of ex-lovers They'll tell you I'm insane (I'm insane) 'Cause you know I love the players And you love the game (And you love the game) 'Cause we're young and we're reckless (Yeah) We'll take this way too far (Ooh) It'll leave you breathless, mm Or with a nasty scar (With a nasty scar) Got a long list of ex-lovers They'll tell you I'm insane But I've got a blank space, baby And I'll write your name",

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods? Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods? Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?

Looking at it now Last December (Last December) We were built to fall apart Then fall back together (Back together) Ooh, your necklace hanging from my neck The night we couldn't quite forget When we decided, we decided To move the furniture so we could dance Baby, like we stood a chance Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying And I remember thinking Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods? Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet? (Oh) Are we out of the woods? Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good (Are we out of the woods?) Remember when you hit the brakes too soon? Twenty stitches in the hospital room When you started crying, baby, I did too But when the sun came up, I was looking at you Remember when we couldn't take the heat? I walked out, I said, \"I'm setting you free\" But the monsters turned out to be just trees When the sun came up, you were looking at me You were looking at me, oh You were looking at me (Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?) (Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?) I remember (Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?) (Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good) Oh, I remember Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet? (Yeah) Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods? Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet? (Say, are we?) Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods? Are we in the clear yet? (Yeah) Are we in the clear yet? (Yeah) Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good (Clear yet? Good) Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods? Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good (Do you remember?) Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods? Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet?

Twenty stitches in the hospital room When you started crying, baby, I did too But when the sun came up, I was lookin' at you Remember when we couldn't take the heat? I walked out, I said, \"I'm settin' you free\" But the monsters turned out to be just trees When the sun came up, you were lookin' at me You were lookin' at me, oh, you were looking at me (Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?) (Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?) I remember (Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?) (Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet?

There were flashin' lights At least I had the decency To keep my nights out of sight Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs And my whispered sighs Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin' Off of very tall somethings Just to see you come runnin' And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no Let's fast forward to three hundred awkward blind dates later (Oh) If she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her (Oh, no) You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor (Oh) You search in every model's bed for somethin' greater, baby Was it over when she laid down on your couch?

Cursing my name, wishing I stayed Look at how my tears ricochet And I can go anywhere I want Anywhere I want, just not home And you can aim for my heart, go for blood But you would still miss me in your bones And I still talk to you (When I'm screaming at the sky) And when you can't sleep at night  (You hear my stolen lullabies) I didn't have it in myself to go with grace And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same Cursing my name, wishing I stayed You turned into your worst fears And you're tossing out blame, drunk on this pain Crossing out the good years And you're cursing my name, wishing I stayed Look at how my tears ricochet",

And isn't it just so pretty to think All along there was some Invisible string Tying you to me?

Would you want me? Would you tell me to go fuck myself Or lead me to the garden? In the garden, would you trust me If I told you it was just a summer thing? I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything But I know I miss you Betty, I know where it all went wrong Your favorite song was playing From the far side of the gym I was nowhere to be found I hate the crowds, you know that Plus, I saw you dance with him You heard the rumors from Inez You can't believe a word she says Most times, but this time, it was true The worst thing that I ever did Was what I did to you But if I just showed up at your party Would you have me? Would you want me? Would you tell me to go fuck myself Or lead me to the garden? In the garden, would you trust me If I told you it was just a summer thing? I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything But I know I miss you I was walking home on broken cobblestones Just thinking of you when she pulled up like A figment of my worst intentions She said, \"James, get in, let's drive\" Those days turned into nights Slept next to her, but I dreamt of you all summer long Betty, I'm here on your doorstep And I planned it out for weeks now But it's finally sinkin' in Betty, right now is the last time I can dream about what happens when You see my face again The only thing I wanna do Is make it up to you So I showed up at your party Yeah, I showed up at your party Yeah, I showed up at your party Will you have me? Will you love me? Will you kiss me on the porch In front of all your stupid friends? If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it? Will it patch your broken wings? I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything But I know I miss you Standing in your cardigan Kissin' in my car again Stopped at a streetlight You know I miss you",

Your integrity makes me seem small You paint dreamscapes on the wall I talk shit with my friends, it's like I'm wasting your honor And you know that I'd swing with you for the fences Sit with you in the trenches Give you my wild, give you a child Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other Family that I chose, now that I see your brother as my brother Is it enough? But there's robbers to the east, clowns to the west I'd give you my sunshine, give you my best But the rain is always gonna come if you're standin' with me But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm If your cascade, ocean wave blues come All these people think love's for show But I would die for you in secret The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?

When we were younger, down in the park Honey, makin' a lark of the misery You got shiny friends since you left town A tiny screen's the only place I see you now And I got nothin' but well wishes for ya Ooh This place is the same as it ever was Ooh But you won't like it that way It's never too late to come back to my side The stars in your eyes shined brighter in Tupelo And if you're ever tired of bеin' known for who you know You know that you'll always know me Dorothea, uh-uh Dorothea, ah-ah Ooh You'rе a queen sellin' dreams, sellin' makeup and magazines Ooh From you, I'd buy anything Hey, Dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me? When it was calmer, skippin' the prom Just to piss off your mom and her pageant schemes And damn, Dorothea, they all wanna be ya But are you still the same soul I met under the bleachers? Well Ooh I guess I'll never know Ooh And you'll go on with the show But it's never too late to come back to my side The stars in your eyes shined brighter in Tupelo And if you're ever tired of bein' known for who you know You know, you'll always know me Dorothea, uh-uh Dorothea, ah-ah Ooh, ooh Ooh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh Ooh, ooh Ooh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh Dorothea (Ah-ah-ah) Ah-ah Ooh",

Did I close my fist around something delicate? Did I shatter you? And I'm sitting on a bench in Coney Island Wondering, where did my baby go? The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go Sorry for not making you my centerfold Over and over Lost again with no surprises Disappointments, close your eyes And it gets colder and colder When the sun goes down The question pounds my head What's a lifetime of achievement If I pushed you to the edge But you were too polite to leave me? And do you miss the rogue Who coaxed you into paradise and left you there? Will you forgive my soul When you're too wise to trust me and too old to care? 'Cause we were like the mall before the internet It was the one place to be The mischief, the gift-wrapped suburban dreams Sorry for not winning you an arcade ring Over and over Lost again with no surprises Disappointments, close your eyes And it gets colder and colder When the sun goes down Were you waiting at our old spot In the tree line by the gold clock Did I leave you hanging every single day? Were you standing in the hallway With a big cake, happy birthday Did I paint your bluest skies the darkest grey? A universe away And when I got into the accident The sight that flashed before me was your face But when I walked up to the podium I think that I forgot to say your name I'm on a bench in Coney Island Wondering, where did my baby go? The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go Sorry for not making you my centerfold Over and over Lost again with no surprises Disappointments, close your eyes And it gets colder and colder When the sun goes down When the sun goes down The sight that flashed before me was your face When the sun goes down But I think that I forgot to say your name Over and over Sorry for not making you my, making you my Making you my centerfold",

Crescent moon, coast is clear Spring breaks loose, but so does fear He's gonna burn this house to the ground How's one to know? I'd live and die for moments that we stole On begged and borrowed time So tell me to run Or dare to sit and watch what we'll become And drink my husband's wine Oh, goddamn My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand Taking mine, but it's been promised to another Oh, I can't Stop you putting roots in my dreamland My house of stone, your ivy grows And now I'm covered in you And I'm covered in you So yeah, it's a fire It's a goddamn blaze in the dark And you started it You started it So yeah, it's a war It's the goddamn fight of my life And you started it You started it Oh, I can't Stop you putting roots in my dreamland My house of stone, your ivy grows And now I'm covered In you, in you Now I'm covered in you In you",

To be certain we'll be tall again Whether weather be the frost Or the violence of the dog days I'm on waves, out being tossed Is there a line that I could just go cross? And when I was shipwrecked (Can't think of all the cost now) I thought of you (All the things that will be lost now) In the cracks of light (Can we just get a pause?) I dreamed of you (To be certain we'll be tall again) (If you think of all the cost) It was real enough (Whether weather be the frost) To get me through (Or the violence of the dog days) (Or the violence of the dog days) (Out on waves, being tossed) (I'm on waves, out being tossed) But I swear (Is there a line that we can just go cross?) You were there And I was catchin' my breath Floors of a cabin creakin' under my step And I couldn't be sure I had a feeling so peculiar This pain wouldn't be for Evermore Evermore (Evermore) Evermore (Evermore) This pain wouldn't be for evermore Evermore",

Sobbing with your head in your hands Ain't that the way shit always ends? You were standing hollow-eyed in the hallway Carnations you had thought were roses, that's us I feel you, no matter what The rubies that I gave up And I lost you The one I was dancing with In New York, no shoes Looked up at the sky and it was (Maroon) The burgundy on my t-shirt When you splashed your wine into me And how the blood rushed into my cheeks So scarlet, it was (Maroon) The mark they saw on my collarbone The rust that grew between telephones The lips I used to call home So scarlet, it was maroon And I wake with your memory over me That's a real fucking legacy, legacy (It was maroon) And I wake with your memory over me That's a real fucking legacy to leave The burgundy on my t-shirt When you splashed your wine into me And how the blood rushed into my cheeks So scarlet, it was maroon The mark they saw on my collarbone The rust that grew between telephones The lips I used to call home So scarlet, it was maroon It was maroon It was maroon",

(A tale as old as time) I wake up screaming from dreaming One day, I'll watch as you're leaving And life will lose all its meaning (For the last time) It's me, hi I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me) At teatime, everybody agrees I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money She thinks I left them in the will The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out \"She's laughing up at us from Hell\" It's me, hi I'm the problem, it's me It's me, hi I'm the problem, it's me It's me, hi Everybody agrees, everybody agrees It's me, hi (Hi) I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me) At teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees (Everybody agrees) I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero",

Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room And every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you But fifteen seconds later, thеy were clappin' too? Then what did you do? Did you lеave her house in the middle of the night? Oh Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh When she said it was too much? Do you wish you could still touch her? It's just a question Half-moon eyes, bad surprise Did you realize out of time? She was on your mind with some dickhead guy That you saw that night But you were on somethin' It was one drink after another Fuckin' politics and gender roles And you're not sure and I don't know Got swept away in the gray I just may like to have a conversation Can I ask you a question? Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room And every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you But fifteen seconds later, they were clappin' too? Then what did you do? Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? Oh Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh When she said it was too much? Do you wish you could still touch her? It's just a question Does it feel like everything's just like Second best after that meteor strike? And what's that that I heard? That you're still with her? That's nice, I'm sure that's what's suitable And right, but tonight Can I ask you a question? (Can I ask you a question?)

And the first night that you saw me Nothing was gonna stop me I laid the groundwork, and then Just like clockwork The dominoes cascaded in a line What if I told you I'm a mastermind? And now you're mine It was all by dеsign 'Cause I'm a mastermind You see, all the wisеst women Had to do it this way 'Cause we were born to be the pawn In every lover's game If you fail to plan, you plan to fail Strategy sets the scene for the tale I'm the wind in our free-flowing sails And the liquor in our cocktails What if I told you none of it was accidental? And the first night that you saw me I knew I wanted your body I laid the groundwork, and then Just like clockwork The dominoes cascaded in a line What if I told you I'm a mastermind? And now you're mine It was all my design 'Cause I'm a mastermind No one wanted to play with me as a little kid So I've been scheming like a criminal ever since To make them love me and make it seem effortless This is the first time I've felt the need to confess And I swear I'm only cryptic and Machiavellian 'Cause I care So I told you none of it was accidental And the first night that you saw me Nothing was gonna stop me I laid the groundwork, and then Saw a wide smirk on your face You knew the entire time You knew that I'm a mastermind And now you're mine Yeah, all you did was smile 'Cause I'm a mastermind",

All that I wanted was to be wanted Too young to wander London streets, alone and haunted Born into nothing At least you have something, something to cling to Visions of dazzling rooms I'll never get let into And the memories were lost long ago But at least you have beautiful ghosts And so maybe my home isn't what I had known What I thought it would be But I feel so alive with these phantoms of night And I know that this life isn't safe, but it's wild and it's free All that I wanted was to be wanted I'll never wander London streets, alone and haunted Born into nothing With them, I have something, something to cling to I never knew I'd love this world they've let me into And the memories were lost long ago So I'll dance with these beautiful ghosts And the memories were lost long ago So I'll dance with these beautiful ghosts",

You can change your hair and you can change your clothes You can change your mind, that’s just the way it goes You can say \"goodbye,\" and you can say \"hello\" But you’ll always find your way back home You can change your style, you can change your jeans You can learn to fly and you can chase your dreams You can laugh and cry, but everybody knows You’ll always find your way back home Your best friends, your little hometown Are waiting up wherever you go now You know that you can always turn around (Turn around) 'Cause this world is big and it’s crazy (It's crazy) And this girl is thinking that maybe This life is what some people dream about (Dream about) 'Cause when I’m feeling down and I am all alone (And I am all alone) I’ve always got a place where I can go 'Cause I know...

And what if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into? And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through? What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?

Here we go She was aware of her insecurities as she took the stage She was convinced if she got up there That she'd be discovered someday So she belted it, she hit the high notes fearlessly Oh she melted them, as she brought them to their feet She was a big star at Banana Joe's bar Where she sang karaoke every night She said if you work hard to get where you are It feels good in the hot spotlight She was a big star She made the local cable shows Where the camera fell in love with her face After a couple of weekends The groupies were crawling all over the place She signed autographs like she was Garth Brooks in a skirt And in the aftermath, that small time town was hers She was a Big star at Banana Joe's bar Where she sang karaoke every night She said if you work hard to get where you are It feels good in the hot spotlight She was a big star She doesn't care anymore That her high school girlfriends put her down The only thought she entertains Is where they are and where she is now Everybody Her old neighbors swear they're certain she slept her way to the top She knows you don't get where you're going Unless you got something they ain't got So she sings tonight to 20,000 plus And the young girls scream out loud for Miss Taylor Swift Man that could be us, she was a Big star at Banana Joe's bar Where she sang karaoke every night She said if you work hard to get where you are It feels good in the hot spotlight She was a big star Look who showed up Happy birthday, Kenny Chesney I love you, Nashville We love you, thank you, Taylor",

    "song_lyrics": "Macavity's a mystery cat, he's called the Hiddenpaw For he's the master criminal who can defy the law He's the bafflement of Scotland Yard, the Flying Squad's despair For when they reach the scene of crime, Macavity's not there Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity He's broken every human law , he breaks the law of gravity His powers of levitation would make a fakir stare But when they reach the scene of crime, Macavity's not there Macavity's a ginger cat , he's very tall and thin You would know him if you saw him for his eyes are sunken in His brow is deeply lined with thought, his head is highly domed His coat is dusty from neglect, his whiskers are uncombed He sways his head from side to side, with movements like a snake And when you think he's half asleep, he's always wide awake Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity For he's a fiend in feline shape, a monster of depravity You may meet him in a by-street, you may see him in the square But when a crime's discovered, then Macavity's not there He's outwardly respectable, I know, he cheats at cards And his footprints are not found in any files of Scotland Yard's And when the larder's looted and the jewel case is rifled Or when the milk is missing or another peke's been stifled Or the greenhouse glass is broken and the trellis past repair There's the wonder of the thing, Macavity's not there Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity He always has an alibi, and one or two to spare What ever time the deed took place, Macavity wasn't there And they say that all the cats whose wicked deeds are widely known I might mention Mungojerrie, Rumpleteazer, Griddlebone Are nothing more than agents for the cat who all the time Just controls the operations, the Napoleon of Crime Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity He's a fiend in feline shape, a monster of depravity You may meet him in a by-street, you may see him in the square But when a crime's discovered, then Macavity, Macavity Macavity, Macavity When a crime's discovered, then Macavity's not there",
