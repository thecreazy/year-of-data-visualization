    "Review Content": "This is what Hollywood needs. A great story with a great director/producer. After that the best thing a studio can do is get the hell out of the way and let artists create art.Dune Part 2 is creative, beautiful, tragic, and mesmerizing. Never once did I get bored or anticipate what was going to happen next. I haven't read the book so I have nothing to compare it to.Denis Villeneuve continues to amaze me with the effort he puts into each of his films. The acting in this film was top notch too. We saw it in IMAX and the sound was earth shattering. If you're gonna see this movie, see it on the largest screen possible.",

    "Review Content": "Phenomenal stuff. I'll probably calm down tomorrow but right now my heart's beating like crazy and my brain's screaming it's a bloody masterpiece. This is one of the few movies that I didn't try to control my expectations beforehand and it still surpassed them in many ways.\"Power over spice is power over all\"- that kinda turned out to be a lie at the end. As The movie starts, I felt an immediate sense of tension through its score. It's a cinematic experience; I can't imagine feeling the same lying at home in bed, watching in headphones. The resonating vibrations as the sounds reverberate through the theater created an epic atmosphere.When Part One came out people said it was \"game of thrones in space\", I wasn't really taken by that as much, especially since people said the same about Apple TV's Foundation series. So I just enjoyed the movie as Dune and bore no comparisons. After watching part two however I see it; the world building, the politics, the epic grandeur of it all.However, the first half of Dune Part Two is pretty grounded and calm, delving into the lives of the Fremen. It almost feels like two distinct movies, the first half intricately setting the stage for the climactic third act and reinforcing character connections established in Dune Part One. Unlike the Part One's focus on lore, this movie is more devotion-driven, also resembling a political narrative, especially knowing of the hidden puppeteers behind the empire. The result appears to be an intricate web of schemes involving the empire, the witch-advisor women(can't spell their names lol), and the Baron's family. Despite the emperor's pulling the strings, the Baron's family still felt like main antagonist to me.The second half of the movie is where we see the epic scale of dune. The movies not quick paced but you couldn't tell, I was absolutely immersed in it.I absolutely loved the kind \"The mahdi is too humble to say he is the mahdi.\" Theatre burst out in laughter. It felt weird, I wasn't expecting any humour. It's funnier than I expected. More lively than the first Dune movie. I'd already seen the Usul-worm-riding scene from the Dune Part One reopening bonus content. I was still just as excited and it didn't spoil a thing.The visual brilliance, as expected was stunning, elevating every aspect. The authenticity of the scenes made it feel as if characters were immersed in the environment, rather than merely placed against a green screen. I loved the portrayal of time passing through Paul's changing eyes; the longer he stays the bluer his eyes get. Despite how lively it is, the plot, while progressing at a measured pace, remains engaging, drawing attention away from its deliberate slowness. It has much more action, the battles were absolutely epic, I feel like they could have been longer but they still captivated me.Jessica disappears for a while, but just when I thought that, she showed up. Other than Paul and Zendeya, the rest of the cast doesn't really get as much screen time as you'd think. I loved the baby/embryo/featus scenes. Batista with no mask in the desert while his whole team's suited up was badass. I love him in darker roles, although I think some moments felt overly animated. But it gave an effective contrast to Austin Butler though, I couldn't wait to see what his character was like. Very fierce, intimidating and psycho. The girl shivering with the plate in her hands before the gladiator games made me chuckle. Butler did also sound like the baron at times.Dune: Part Two stands steady on its own, it felt complete compared to the more introductory feel of Part One. Despite this, I still felt like it lays groundwork for Dune: Part Three/Messiah, leaving a sense of setup. The movie, while feeling like a precursor, still manages to provide a more conclusive ending. I also think you should watch Part One first, if that has to be said; and the prospect of a back-to-back viewing sounds like a fun afternoon.One thing I can complain about is Stilger. I have mixed feelings. In Part One, Javier was fierce and was my favorite character, in this movie though he's depicted as a religious fanatic for the most part. It was done well, but I still miss the Stilgar who walked up to Duke Leto Atreides with no disregard. This felt like a different person, still fierce, just different.Loved Austin butler though, I wasn't sure what to expect as I tried my best to avoid trailers and teasers apart from the Dune part one bonus content. That short lady in charge of extracting 'the water of life' had some insane calves on her, I'm extremely jealous.While I was initially not convinced about Timothée Chalamet as the lead, he truly owns the role in the sequel, displayed acting facets I'd not seen before from him. The movie essentially unfolds as Paul Atreides' coming-of-age story, with Zendaya delivering an amazing performance. The first act, focusing on their love story, adds depth to the events at the movie's end. Zendaya's portrayal transcends the typical love story, I hope her role extends into Dune: Messiah, and hopefully adds further complexity to her character.We see Paul undergo some transformations. From being the son of royalty to experiencing love, the narrative takes a surprising turn when he assumes authority in the third act. Although I liked it, it felt a bit rushed. But, I found solace/logic with the \"water of life\" spiritual poison, where drinking it resulted in a profound shift in your personality. The contrast between the before and after versions of Paul, as well as Jessica, is striking so it kinda made sense to me.I think watching this movie at home won't do it justice, it's clearly made for the big screens if you can. It's pretty epic and I think it'll remain memorable as one of 2024's best movies, despite only being February. I absolutely loved it.",

It is the kind of experience you had once.. but you never thought you would get again.. until this movie proves you WRONG!!This movie takes the aspects of the first movie and improves upon them in almost every way possible, already writing itself into the books of greatest sequels of ALL TIME!!Everything in this movie was TOP notch! Dennis Villeneauve proves why he is not only a master of Sci-Fi movies, but just filmmaking in general! This was a demonstration of power, in what you can achieve with filmmaking!I beg you to watch this on the biggest and best screen you can find! This will be an experience that will stick with you forever!I thought the real Blockbuster was dead.. but I was wrong! This is the cinematic experience i craved!Now I am gonna watch this movie again, and maybe again! Then I am gonna read the books!",

    "Review Content": "If you liked or loved the first one, the same will apply for this one. Personally, I loved this one even more and I think general audiences will as well. So I hope it does well at the box office because I need Dune Messiah now. This is everything I love about going to the movies. Also, Hans Zimmer.For book readers, I'd say this one takes more liberties than the first, but they were changes I liked, some for the better even. For the most part, it still hits the main beats from the book with a few things altered. The biggest change being no time jump. Therefore, a certain character doesn't fully appear in the movie contrary to the book. Though, they still use the character in a different way that I liked personally.I know it's early in the year, but you can lock some Oscar nominations for this movie: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Editing, Best Cinematography, Best Score, Best Sound, Best Visual Effects, Best Costume, Best Production Design, Best Makeup, and hopefully Rebecca Ferguson this time for Best Supporting Actress. I guess that's pretty much every category now that I've typed it out lol.",

    "Review Content": "Had the pleasure to watch this film in an early screening and was completely blown away.As a big fan of the Game of Thrones franchise, it's been a long time since iv'e encountered this level of world-building and epicness. Would highly recommend to re-watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better, though it's not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self-contained and would please general audience that only watched the first movie 3 years ago just as well.Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time, and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high-budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does.In my personal opinion, the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect. Hans Zimmer's score is masterful just as you'd expect, and one step up from the Oscar winner and Grammy nominated score of Pt. 1. Technical aspects such as VFX, Production Design, Sound, Editing, etc. Are all top notch and awards-worthy. The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine. Denis direction is impeccable, and the story is absolutely fascinating- continuing to develop characters from Pt. 1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters.The movie serves as a great wrap-up to the story introduced in Pt. 1 however in my opinion could serve as an even better set-up to a possible masterpiece in Dune: Messiah, which I really hope will get green-lit soon.I believe (and surely hope) this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season. Below-the-line wins are pretty much guaranteed as of now, but I hope it will get some love in above-the-line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture, perhaps to break stigmas presented against the Fantasy/Sci-Fi genre in recent years at the Academy. As a big fan of the genre, unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period, maybe it's time for a movie like this to triumph once again.Don't miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX, since I believe it's an historic piece of epic-Fantasy/Sci-Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre.Extremely recommended.",

Not in the longest time has a franchise, and a singular movie, captivated me in such a way. This story, these characters, this planet, Dune, lives rent-free in my mind. You would be doing yourself a disservice not seeing this film in IMAX, as the soundscapes created and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer are so immersive you feel like you are a part of every seen. This movie is a masterpiece in storytelling. 10/10.",

    "Review Date": "2024-03-01",
    "Review Content": "Dune\" has been successfully put to the big screen. Not only is this a good adaptation, it passes with flying colors.The character arc of Paul Atreides is fascinating and complex. I love how they delved into his psyche and motivations so prevalently in this movie. He is reluctant to take up the Messianic mantle because he knows it's a lie. But things go according to his vision and he becomes a morally complex character. Religious fantacism takes hold of the fremen.It is up for interpretation what kind of character Paul becomes. Is he a tyrant? Was it the only path? What does religion have to do with it? Paul takes hold of the Bene Gesserit lie by exploiting faith.This leads to other questions. Can one truly trust the arm of flesh? The frailty of man? Leaders have come and gone throughout history bringing different ideals.One's own morality comes into play. Agency is vital to the human experience. Man will always falter. This leads to questions of a higher power and His role. Is there a God above? What are the implications of that?We don't get stories like this in Hollywood anymore. There is no happy ending in Dune, and one can only ponder the moral complexities of it. The book and movie have made me contemplate many things and I deeply appreciate stories like that.Others have already applauded the effects, acting and script, so I won't go into that too much here. What I will say is it was the best looking movie I have ever seen. Everything looked lived in. The fight scenes were choreographed masterfully. Each actor gave outstanding performances. Hans Zimmer gives a mesmerizing soundtrack.Frank Herbert's vision was honored masterfully. Well done Denis Villeneuve.",

Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista continue their evil.

He did an excellent job placing his vision on the first Dune, but here, Villeneuve cranks his direction times 10!The structure, set-up, visuals, sound and story are crafted in ways that are hard for me to put in words, due to how everything came together so miraculously. The acting is also top-notch! Timothée Chalamet in particular is unbelievably phenomenal, and Zendaya does a great job as well. Austin Butler, Rebecca Ferguson and Florence Pugh are also excellent! Denis never lets you out of this experience! The pure weight of the film is presented through astounding narratives, rich cinematography, an epic story and mesmerizing action sequences that will make your seat rumble if you watch this on the big screen!There are quite a handful of thrilling moments that I still have no idea how they came out THIS good in the end! Denis Villeneuve is truly a sorcerer in the Sci-Fi genre! Every frame and detail in his films are captivating as hell, and it's no different here in the slightest!Dune: Part Two made me leave the theater feeling inspired!

    "Review Date": "2024-03-02",
    "Review Content": "As with the first film, the production was beautiful. I loved the opening scenes with the Harkonnen soldiers. The arena fight between Austin Butler and the last Atreides Robert Yuan (actors names) was fantastic. The battles with the harvesters were phenomenal.The script, however, left me a little bit disappointed. What about the Guild Navigators? And how were the worms used after they came through the pass in the mountains opened up by the atomics? There was only one sequence of the initial charge (marvelous sequence when the gunships entered) but then nothing. The Sardurkar were not given enough respect in this film. There was only one scene that showed them respect and that was when they rose up from the fallen sand and rock debris and stood their ground preparing for the oncoming onslaught instead of panicking. Other than that I felt the film should have spent more time on tactical combat scenes in what was supposed to be an epic battle at the end of the film, maybe trim time off of the other dragged out sequences in the film. The first movie did a better job with the Sardaukar, you actually feared them. The epic battle at the end of this movie was less than epic. And poor Bautista, they should not have made him act like such a wimp, should have had a more glorious fight even in retreat.As much as I like Walken, I thought he was poorly cast to be Emperor. The 1984 film had a perfect actor for the personality. This is Villeneuve's fault, he picked him.The script also fails to emphasize that Paul is the Kwisatz Haderach at the end of the movie. Paul's initial ability to vaguely see the future comes from the centuries of genetic tinkering of the women of the Ben Gesserat, but after he drinks the water of life and not only survives but develops the ability to see an individual's past, as evident by the scenes in the Fremen temple where he looks at individuals and describes their past, and more clearly sees optional future outcomes, and after he actually fulfills all of the prophecies of the Fremen, the story is true, he really is the Messiah of Arrakis, justifying the religion, and he really is the Kwisatz Haderach, a man with abilities that no other man has. But the film appears to gloss over this. Shame. He is not just some populist charismatic man blamed by the likes of Zendaya's character for (perceived) fooling anyone to follow him and falling for the appeal of power and giving up his principles, he is more than that.My critique of the first film was not enough emotion, well part 2 does a better job, especially after Paul survives the water of life and becomes the anti-hero, all hell breaks loose. And Zendaya's character being a more independent women than the 1984 film was interesting, albeit the combat skills or luck were not realistic unless you buy that the Sardaukar were that inept. Part 1 was a better drama than part 2, but part 2 has some great action sequences, besides the disappointments I mentioned earlier. Not a perfect film for this Dune 1984 admirer.",

    "Review Date": "2024-03-02",
    "Review Content": "Frank Herbert's Dune is widely considered to be some of the most challenging science fiction material to adapt to the big screen. In 2021, Villeneuve hit it out of the park with Dune - Part One. In Part Two, he outdoes himself in every way. From cinematography to music to choreography to acting and dialogue, this movie had a mountain to climb to prove itself, and it did.With Hans Zimmer composing the score, it should surprise no one how well it compliments the film. Greig Fraser (Dune - Part One, The Creator, The Batman) was at the helm of cinematography, and really took my breath away with the magnificent vistas, incredible use of colours and even infrared, and expert capture of motion and scale. Fraser explains that they shot in digital, transposed to 35mm, then back to digital. This seemed absurd to me, until he explained that digital appeared too crisp for audiences, and film too nostalgic. His method obtained the perfect balance. I can't fault him for that, because I agree.The real risk here is of course the adaptation. How to retain some of the richest and most beloved science fiction lore in existence and condense it into the 2 hours and 46 minutes runtime. Villeneuve took a huge risk by splitting the first book into two parts. Had studios not green-lit part two, we would have been left with half a book. Unsatisfying for everyone. Thankfully the gamble paid off, and he was able to tell the epic story across two movies bordering on three hours. Even this required a brisk pace, with many notable scenes omitted. Despite this, I think Villeneuve retained the heart and soul of the story. He created two movies which appeal to both general audiences, and fans alike. There is so much to love here that I can't imagine anyone walking away feeling unsatisfied with the price of entry.See this on the biggest screen you can find. Then see it again. The visuals and score demand it. You will not be disappointed.",

The story is on par to the Star Wars legacy, the acting, on par with Oppenheimer, the SFX better than the two movies just mentioned combined. When the movie finished (over 2 and half hours) I still wanted more. The emotional ride was like nothing I can remember from ANY movie I can remember. Best movie of the year?

    "Review Date": "2024-03-01",
    "Review Content": "Denis Villeneuve's second half of his adaptation of Frank Herbert's Dune fully embraces the spectacle inherent in the material while also digging into the core implications that Herbert was exploring around power, cults of personality, and leadership. He flips some things around (I'm pretty sure), but otherwise delivers a handsome, exciting, second half to what he had started. And then he highlights Chani way too much, changing her character so much that she sticks out like a sore thumb to curious purposes that do little more than distract from what's going on around her. Seriously, if the final twenty seconds of this film were chopped off and lost in a fire, I'd actually be a good bit more positive on the film.Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) and his mother the Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) have joined the Fremen led by Stilgar (Javier Barden). Paul grows close to Chani (Zendaya) who helps teach him the ways of the desert as they go into hiding from the dominant Harkonnen led by the Baron (Stellan Skarsgard), his elder nephew Rabban (Dave Bautista) left as governor of the desert planet Arrakis while the Baron continues to groom his younger nephew Feyd (Austin Butler) towards leadership. Operating as an exposition dump for those who didn't remember the first film is Irulan (Florence Pugh), nominally taking up her chronicling duties from the book (her entries marking the start of every chapter), while her father, the Emperor Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken), quietly ruminates on the implications of his plan to eradicate the Atreides perhaps failing.This is one of those stories that I know so well, that I kind of assume that everyone knows. And yet, Dune, for all it's popularity among scifi nerds, isn't the grand cultural touchpoint it's sometimes made out to be. Its influences are strong and wide, but the actual story knowledge isn't.Anyway, now's the time to talk about some creative choices. The first that screams out to me is how much more stylized visually the film is. The film opens with a scene of Harkonnen troops attacking the Fremen in the desert, and Villeneuve uses a partial eclipse as an excuse to bathe the entire scene in a deep orange. It's really nice to look at. I've been curious about the black and white segments in the trailers since I've seen them, and the explanation is that Geidi Prime has a black sun making it so that outside just looks like that. Knowing more from the books, I'd say that the whole Harkonnen look is something I'd attribute more to the Bene Tlielax, but it's at least interesting to see.There's a heavy emphasis on the Bene Gesserit and their breeding program in here, which I appreciate. I think that most heavily gets highlighted in the inclusion of Lady Margot Fenring (Lea Seydoux), a Bene Gesserit sent to Geidi Prime to seduce Feyd, secure his bloodline, and learn how to manipulate him should certain probabilities arise. She is very briefly seen in a modified form in the Sci-Fi Channel series, but otherwise she's never made an appearance in an adaptation. Although, unless Villeneuve is planning on using material from the sequel novels written by Brian Herbert (please no), Lady Fenring shouldn't be making any more appearances, making this feel like something of a dead end that still manages to provide some nice detail in terms of worldbuilding.And that leads me to the editing. I like how much detail gets brought in to help fill out the world (universe) of Dune, but there are some places where the film feels too fast. Take, for instance, the jump from Paul and Chani sitting on a dune watching a wormrider in the distance, Chani explaining to Paul that he'll never become a rider because he's not really Fremen. Cut ahead to about fifteen minutes later in screentime, there's been no mention of Paul training or anything, and now it's time for Paul to ride his first worm. Time has obviously passed, and this feels like the instance of a cut scene that was deemed unnecessary. However, considering how much time gets dedicated to Fenring's seduction of Feyd, it makes you wonder if the priorities were in total alignment when cutting the film down to its current length.So, Paul stays in the northern parts of Arrakis to lead the small revolt of the Fedaykin fighters against the Harkonnen while Jessica, pregnant and having become the Fremen's Reverend Mother through the changing of the Water of Life from poison into a harmless drink (no orgy in this mostly sexless adaptation), a process that awakens her unborn daughter, Alia, into consciousness. Gonna be honest, Jessica talking to Alia outloud is great. It's just the right kind of funny in this universe. Anyway, Jessica becomes a fanatic in the pursuit of Paul's legend as the Mahdi, the Lisan al-Gaib, the Voice from the Outer World, while Paul resists it. If I remember correctly, this is something of a complete reversal where Paul easily fell into the legend to help him fight while Jessica saw it as something of a survival mechanism, an unfortunate path she had to take to stay alive. I don't mind this change because Furgeson as a madwoman is great to watch.Things escalate. The Emperor must come to Arrakis. There is a showdown, and that showdown is great. It reminded me of the epic ending to James Cameron's Avatar, a movie I have no great love for but which, I cannot deny, has a freaking awesome final act action sequence. Atomics, worms, giant spaceships, it all comes together in an action and special effects extravaganza that Villeneuve manages with aplomb. It's great fun.Now, Chani. Chani is given extra prominence, and I really don't like how they did it. She is one of the Fremen who does not believe in the Lisan al-Gaib, and she sticks to that belief through everything she witnesses. As Paul is presenting all of the signs, as Chani herself is becoming part of the prophecy that she rejects through literal actions, she not only resists, but she fights back against it. It's so out of place, and it goes through to the end of the film. Sure, Herbert having Chani blithely accept that the love of her life is going to marry an imperial princess for power was always a bit thin, but turning the ending of the film into watching her pouting is just wrong.The story of Dune is Paul going from boy to man to leader to godhead. It's not Chani being mad that Paul is going from boy to man to leader to godhead. Ending on her was a mistake.Anyway, it's a spectacle. I think it gets the heart of Herbert's message right. It mixes things up to some degree and to not entirely successful effect. As an adaptation of Dune, I think the Sci-Fi miniseries is probably the best, but as a filmed experience, this is the more exciting and complete of the three attempts.",

Part 2 seemed more of a grind.But, even so, I did enjoy it and will probably enjoy it more on 2nd watching.Zendaya was excellent.So was FergusonThe exploration of religion, fanaticism, freedom fighting vs terrorism, was interesting and unusual for a sci-fi movie. It does stand head and shoulders above most blockbusters.Of course, the visuals were stunning, as was the teeth-rattling sound.Although I admire the Director's more measured approach, i.e. Not just churning out a sequel, I'm not sure I'm excited enough for a part 3.",

At the end the movie strayed away from the book which made me a bit sad to be honest. Especially the part (which is very important in the book-storyline) is the fact that the sister of Paul wasn't born yet when the film came to it's conclusion. Where in the book his little sister kills the Baron in the film Paul takes the honor of doing so. Also the fact that Chani is not supporting Paul for taking the hand of the Emperor's daughter, didn't have a child with him yet and actually goes her own way makes it hard to get a good start for the inevitable third movie that has to come. As a movie it was a great experience though. The action is great and the storytelling just as well. I personally wished that they sticked to the book till the end. Part one definitely did follow the book... part two also till the midst of the film. Still I strongly recommend to watch it... it is a must-see movie and ranks as one of my alltime favorites already.",

The set pieces, the cinematography, the use of visual effects and lights, the sound design and music, all, absolutely amazing and almost literally stunning!But then? I'm not really seeing much after that. As I have not read the books, this movie was a total mystery to me. There's barely any dialog--at least not any that would explain anything what's going on at all. The world and the technology etc just doesn't make much sense to me.None of the characters are particularly interesting, to be honest. They don't really have that much personality to them, and even if they did, they didn't really make me care about them all that much.I don't know, I'm a bit conflicted, it wasn't a bad movie and, as I said, it was entertaining and visually mesmerizing, but it lacked the depth that I was expecting of a world this size and this rich with lore and history. Maybe the movie makers assumed everyone has read the books? As someone to who the world is not familiar at all, it just seems rather confusing and strange. I feel like they just focused on making it as visually awesome as they can (in which they arguably succeeded), but left the story on the pages of the books.",

Paul comes to prominence because it seems he may fulfil a prophecy, which may enable him to obtain revenge against the Harkkonens and also the Emperor, who facilitated their action in the first place. But Paul has visions of a war he wants to avoid, and the Bene Gesserit sisterhood have plans of their own.Part Two picks up where the first film left off, and brings the story to a conclusion of sorts (author Frank Herbert wrote five sequels). I was a huge science fiction reader when the original novel was published, but I had a great deal of trouble with it. Its texture and density was a bit too much for me in my mid-teens, and previous film versions didn't help much. I was pleased with Villeneuve's film from 2021, because I could finally follow the story without confusion.Part Two - not so much. The narrative is fairly straightforward, but it often felt as if exposition had been omitted. For instance, Lea Seydoux appears in some tight closeups and meaningful dialogue: she plays Lady Margot Fenring. Who? This is presented as a character of significance, a name actress with image and dialogue delivered using film grammar which shouts Significant! Yet we don't know who she is or why she matters, and we never hear from her again.The performances are good, the visuals are great, but again the story proves difficult to convey without confusion. It's a good film, but it's something of a disappointment compared to its predecessor,",

It bored the heck out of me. It honestly did. I DO LIKE Part Two much better though, it's vibe is completely different (much more bleak and exciting). But it also has got it's flaws and BEWARE, you wont leave the cinema feeling all cheery and revived, because this sequel is quite a heavy mother...The bad: there is a limit to how long I can stand these contineous Hans Zimmer droning booming sounds. They just do not stop. There needs to be some BALANCE in the use of these bombastic sounds. A pause, a silence now and then only enhances the effect. Less is more...More bad: this movie's storyline is all over the place. It feels rushed at moments, confusing at other moments, some characters randomly appear and disappear. Everybody is (rightfully) complaining about this sequel being low on storyline.The good: Part Two has got a mean, vicious bleak spirit, with some really creapy bad guys. They really succeeded in making me being appalled by some of these mean characters. Great!More good: the action is quite dark and intrusive and mesmirising to watch. Almost hypnotizing action visuals.The really good stuff: the actors are simply sublime. They just dont come any better, although I personally do NOT like that they choose Timothee Chalamet for this character. I think he is just not suited for this role. But that is just my personal opinion...Visually it is terrific (as always with director Denis Villeneuve). Storywise it is kinda disappointing. Mixed bag. Certainly NOT worthy of 9 stars, that's simply ridiculous, but still worth a really enjoyable (heavy mother of a) watch nonetheless.Thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!",

With many all-star cast members, all performances were great with not a single performance feeling dull or out of place.Since I haven't read the original book yet, I may not be too familiar with the lore of Dune but the narrative is pretty interesting as some of the concepts, characters and themes explored are pretty good. Including a great soundtrack, uses of dialogue and structures throughout. I honestly don't have any complaints about this one because I was enthralled with the entire movie.Overall, Dune: Part Two is a great continuation of the first film and Villeneuve has proven to be one of the best filmmakers we have right now.",

I loved the first movie and thought it would be an impossibly difficult task to surpass it, but Denis Villeneuve has once again proven himself as the most promising sci-fi director of this age. I find that this installment of the series picks up its pace quickly and reaches its peak near the end of the film. Contrary to the first film where most of the action was packed into the middle. Dune: Part Two displays a more relaxed tone from the start to the middle of the movie, however the mood shifts to match the occasion and finally leaves you somewhat distraught as the consequences of the character's choices surely lead to a path they cannot return from. The cinematography by Greig Fraser is once again fantastic the mixture of his naturalistic style and the sci-fi genre leads to a grounded universe while still retaining the wonderous and whimsical aspects of science fiction, each decision on how planets and characters are portrayed demonstrates the care and attention paid to how audiences interpret them, you understand the Harkonnen, the Emperor, the Fremen, the Bene Gesserit and the remnants of house Atreides in one look at the way they are shown. The score is once again sublime, Hans Zimmer once again proves himself as the definitive motion picture composer, his ability to craft larger-than-life scores with his ability to understand the differences between each character and culture present in this film is nothing short of perfection, recurring themes and motifs are present throughout the movie and paired with the visuals and the performances, which are also incredible, form a modern day masterpiece crafted meticulously by masters of their respective fields. Rebecca Ferguson, Timothée Chalamet, Javier Bardem, Austin Butler and Zendaya give wonderful performances, with the first three being standouts. Overall this movie deserves the universal praise it has received and might just interest those who didn't even enjoy the first installment of the series.",

    "Review Date": "2024-02-29",
    "Review Content": "I had great hopes for \"Dune: part two\" since I really liked the first part but I was left a bit disappointed. Once again the technical aspect of the production is phenomenal: everything is very well crafted (direction, cinematography, production design, performances, score) and it is undoubtedly a big part of the film which has to be recognized and that it saves it for me. This is because the narrative part has a lot of issues. If the first movie was still slow paced, it was able to create an imaginary and become iconic, it had the purpose of setting up the second part and I thought some sort of payoff was coming in \"part two\". Instead even the second movie is all setup with a final battle which lasts like 15 minutes and a very rushed and anticlimactic finale. But if the first part took more its time to better justify the characters' actions, this second part doesn't do that (maybe more screen time would have beneficial). Many times characters do things out of nowhere or because the story needs them but their actions doesn't feel earned and justified in most cases. I'm not saying it's all bad and I liked the movie (the rating shows that) but it could have been so much more.The other issue is that this part two in the end is essentially part one but three years later, it has all the same merits and defects. It is technically exceptional and it is surely able to impress and foment. On the flip side they both were not able to make the viewer empathize much with the characters and the worst thing of all: it is once again truncated. I accepted it for the first one because it was a build up and because it was the first part of the book, but here it's bad. I get that there is a sequel coming (in theory) but the story is interrupted once again. I've read comparisons to \"Empire Strikes Back\" because it was the middle part of a trilogy, but the plot of that movie was closed. Indeed the last shot of \"Episode V\" is a clear indication of the closure of the story narrated but opening to the fact that \"something is more to come, the final battle is nearing\". \"Dune: part two\" is instead cut anticlimactically.Unfortunately I'm pretty disappointed by \"Dune: part two\" which was the movie I was expecting the most this year. I liked it but I felt a lot of wasted potential. It could have been something truly epic and for the ages, instead it has major issues that reduce the impact of the movie itself.",

    "Review Title": "Hard Not to Compare it to the Book and Feel Disappointed",
    "Review Date": "2024-03-02",
    "Review Content": "I'm going to write this as a review for both Dune movies, so I'll include my thoughts about Dune part one throughout. For me, the most difficult part about rating these movies is trying to judge them as they stand on their own without comparing them to the original book.As movies, I think both are great: the cinematography is amazing, the sound design is good, the acting is good, I liked the visual style and how they interpreted the various technologies of the world of Dune. The soundtrack is good, it can be a little overbearing at times but the music in part two felt like an improvement on this from part one. One of the biggest complaints people had with both movies is the pacing, saying that the first movie was dragging and the second was rushing. I agree with the sentiments about the latter, but personally I enjoyed the slower pacing of the first Dune movie. The second movie definitely moves quickly through its first half, then it slows down a lot in the second half before rushing to its conclusion.The casting is good for the most part, I personally disagree with casting Rebecca Ferguson but I'll get into that more later. In the first movie I wasn't especially impressed with Timothée Chalamet as Paul but I think he does better in the role in the second part. Jason Momoa was a perfect pick for Duncan Idaho and Oscar Isaac did a great job as Duke Leto. Stellan Skarsgard was a good choice for Baron Harkonnen but I think he could have been written better. I was really looking forward to seeing Christopher Walken as the Emperor Shaddam but unfortunately he felt pretty lifeless and didn't bring very much energy to the scenes he was in.Overall, as they stand on their own, the Dune movies are great films. I don't know if I'd call them the defining sci-fi movies of the 21st century like other people are saying, but they're still very good, definitely rewatchable, and I would recommend them.Now, moving on to comparing them to the books, because once you start doing that you get to the more disappointing side of these movies. One of the biggest issues with both movies, especially the second, is that they almost completely leave out the ecological message of the book. This is a book that has been used as a textbook in environmental science classes, but I guess the filmmakers decided that message wasn't important enough. The Fremen are shown to be working towards terraforming Dune into a green world, slowly but surely making wind traps and planting grasses to fix the dunes in place. It's a goal that they are working towards with total commitment even though they know that it won't be realized for several generations. That's a powerful message that I think a lot more people need to hear nowadays, especially in reference to the issue of climate change. The movie barely mentions this goal at all, which I think is a disservice to the original story, and it diminishes the Fremen as characters.I think the fundamental issue that these movies have with their adaptations is an understandable one, but that it could've been solved in a better way. The main issue with adapting the book is that the characters are very difficult to relate to: most of them are superhumans who have insane abilities. For the movies, a lot of the main characters are altered to make them more relatable to the audience, which is an understandable change. For some characters, this greatly improves them from the book, such as Duncan Idaho and Duke Leto. For others, like Chani and Jessica, it reduces the strength of their characters, which I'll explain more later.Additionally, the book has a lot of complex concepts and story plots that it never stops to fully explain to the reader, you're just supposed to pick it up as you go along and reread it to understand, making it a little obtuse. Dune is very dialogue-heavy, with a lot of the action happening in the background or only described briefly. To remedy this, the movies remove some of the more complex topics and add more action scenes, which are exciting and well choreographed, but in the second movie they start feeling repetitive and redundant, and they overpower the more intricate plot points.While the first movie cleverly managed to insert a lot of exposition without feeling like it was constantly lore dumping, part two feels like it's more afraid to explain things than the first, possibly because of complaints that \"nothing happened\" in the first movie. The result of this is that the second movie is much more action-heavy, but it still wants to include the complex topics from the book, so what we get is a bunch of action sequences with scenes of political complexities strung in between them, but without the full explanations necessary to clarify them. It's easy to understand why people who haven't read the books would feel confused by this, the movie barely takes the time to explain what's happening before it's moving on to the next scene of Fremen blowing up spice haulers.Getting into direct comparisons to the book now, and starting with the first movie: my two biggest issues with the first movie was how they changed Jessica and how they dumbed down the mentats. Starting with mentats, they are a hugely important part of all of the Dune books; Thufir Hawat is essentially a main character in the first book, and Peter de Vries is a terrifying mastermind behind the Harkonnen plans. Part of what triggers Paul's first vision of the coming Jihad in his name is that his mother tells him he was trained as a mentat from birth without his knowledge. In the movie, the word mentat is never said once; Paul's mentat training isn't brought up; Thufir Hawat is just a guy who rolls his eyes back in his head, says something smart and then disappears at the halfway mark; and Peter de Vries dies of poisoning. How disappointing.But what I think is the worse change that they made from the book is how they changed Jessica's character. While the Dune books get much more feminist as they go on, the first book has very few female characters. However, Jessica makes for a very strong main character: she has complete control over her mind and body, and through her Bene Gesserit training she has almost superhuman strength, speed, and can control others with the Voice. Her internal monologue also shows that she's almost always two steps ahead of everyone except Paul. In the movies, Jessica feels much weaker. In the first movie she's almost always crying or on the verge of tears, which makes it a lot believable when she starts killing Harkonnens with her bear hands, and it makes the scene in the tent when Paul gets his vision (the only part of the book where Jessica openly grieves) much less powerful.Moving on to the second movie is where the changes get more disappointing. The movie begins with Paul, Jessica and the Fremen fighting the Harkonnens in some battle between the fight with Jamis and them getting to Sietch Tabr, which wasn't in the book and felt like it was added for the sake of starting with an action sequence. After the fight, Jessica throws up involuntarily --- again, as a Bene Gesserit she should have total control over her body and it doesn't make sense for her to do that, even though she's pregnant.Speaking of Jessica's child, Alia isn't really a character in this, at least not like she was in the book. I can understand this, I had no idea how they were going to handle having a toddler who walks and talks like an adult and kills a man, and they handled it by having Jessica not give birth during the movie. They also don't really explain how Alia is pre-born, which is a piece of information that people who didn't read the book could probably use.Once Paul and Jessica get to Sietch Tabr, things feel a lot different. The book describes the interiors of the Sietch as being covered with drapery, rugs, and cushions. There are classrooms, plastic factories, and workshops. The movie doesn't show this at all: the Sietch interior is all smooth, carved stone rather than natural rock walls, there's no textiles to be seen, and essentially only the water reservoir is shown. In general, the depiction of the Fremen in the movie is much worse than the book. The Fremen are a very tight-knit community where people understand each other's needs so well that they don't even need to communicate them out loud. When Jessica feels like she needs a coffee, a Fremen with coffee simply appears without her giving an order. In the movie the Fremen are three things: good at stabbing people, fanatic believers in Paul, or people who hate the Mahdi prophecy and don't believe in Paul. In the book, this dissenting faction against Paul isn't really present, and Chani definitely isn't part of it. I can understand that the filmmakers probably added it to help drive home the anti-hero worship message which a lot of people missed from the book, but it could have been executed better.I also disliked how they changed Chani. In the books she very easily falls for Paul and gives him unwavering support, and I think it's fine that they wanted to make that more nuanced for the movies, but I don't like the way they did it. The movie wants us to think that they love each other even though it constantly shows Chani ranting against the prophecy and disagreeing with Paul's actions. In the end, she leaves Paul after he agrees to marry the Emperor's daughter Irulan (even though in the book he makes it clear that he is only marrying her for politics, refuses to even touch her, and has three children with Chani instead). This ending will definitely complicate things if they do go through with adapting Dune Messiah to complete the film trilogy.I'm running out of room to write, and most people probably won't read this anyway because of the length, so I'll just say again that I enjoyed the movies and think they're good, but some of the changes they made, especially in part two, were disappointing and could have been executed better.",

    "Review Title": "Too much hype for this overrated sequel",
    "Review Date": "2024-03-02",
    "Review Content": "I tried not to feel conditioned by the hype around this movie, but I was quite dissapointed after watching it.After a superb part one, which was a magical exhibition of cinema and an aesthetic pleasure, this second part is quite pretentious. Looks like the style exercise of an artist in love with himself, and seems that the story is a secondary factor here.It is like, \"ok, did you like the scenes of the thumper calling the sandworm?, here you have like twenty scenes of a thumper calling sandworms, and even a scene with twenty thumpers calling sandworms at the same time; did you like the beautiful faces of Zendaya and Rebecca Ferguson in the desert, with great Hans Zimmer music?, ok, here you have fifty seven shots of the beautiful faces in dramatic moments of all the extremely pretty actresses we have been able to recruit for this\". The problem is that quantity does not compensate for the loss of the surprise effect.In fact, the story is just an excuse for an interminable exhibition of close-ups of the incredibly beautiful faces of the female cast, no less beautiful desert sceneries, and an interminable succession of sand worm ridings.Flat and hollow aesthetics, with a really poor storytelling. The story is confusing, with a first act focused in the Fremen, but with no real advance of the story, just Fremen in the desert, Fremen worshiping the mesiah, Fremen riding worms, worshiping again, Chani frowning at the inmensity of the desert with deep music, and so on (actually, Chani spent all movie frowning). Actually, the first act was terribly boring.Then, the abuse of ellipsis makes the story rush forward, to the point of losing sense sometimes. It is really difficult to follow it without any previous knowledge of what happened in the original novel.This rush lead to weird situations, as when suddenly Chani shows up out from nowhere in a ornithopter, and you ask yourself why and how she ended flying that thing.The rush to close the story causes the last act to be resolved hastily and sloppily. The expected final battle is resolved very quick and lacking epic and glory. The supposedly powerful and fearsome Sardaukar appears in the last battle as a few random guys without any combat abilities. The formerly powerful emperor and Harkonnen, are now weak and do not stand a chance against the new dark mesiah and their fundamentalist troops.Overall, the movie lost all the magic and mistery of the first part, and it is just an exhibition of style from a director that seems to be more in love with himself than with the story he is telling.About acting, all the cast are doing a great job. Special mention to the superb Javier Bardem, who, together with Zendaya, support all the movie on their shoulders. All the Harkonnen are doing a great job and are the most interesting characters, both in acting and aesthetically. To me, Paul Atreides is the worst part, plain and lacking substance and the you could expect from the leader of a holy war against a galactic empire.In summary, a pretentious sequel larguely inferior to the first part in all aspects.",

    "Review Content": "Austin Butler sheds his Elvis accent while Timothee Chalamet continues to sharpen his jawline as the Fremen's messiah.Dune: Part Two is an absolute sci-fi masterpiece. Director Denis Villeneuve expertly builds upon the solid foundation laid by the first film injecting politics, religion, and romance.The acting here is fantastic with standouts being Austin Butler, who is psychotic and creepy as Feyd-Rautha, along with Rebecca Ferguson, who takes on something totally different than the last film's characterization of Lady Jessica.Greig Fraser is also a standout as the cinematographer along with the entire vfx team. This group is incredibly talented, using a very limited color palette to create stunningly realistic sandworms, spaceships, and otherworldly armies.The sound mixing department and Hans Zimmer's score also work hand in hand to create an oddly pleasing yet deafening IMAX theater experience. This film is so loud and grand.I also respect how Denis Villeneuve is sticking to his guns that he had while filming Sicario: he doesn't want to glorify the violence as he wants to show its effects on its victims. While the film is visually stunning, the violence is what it is. It's brutal and not over the top.Overall, Dune showcases the best sci-fi has to offer with a great adaptation of Frank Herbert's space drama created with top tier acting and production.",

    "Review Date": "2024-03-03",
    "Review Content": "This movie is a visual masterpiece that will be studied for decades. The colors are vivid, the lighting is gorgeous and the cgi is mostly indistinguishable from reality.That said, despite being almost 3 hours long, the story felt hugely condensed. It felt like each scene gives you the bare minimum to understand what's happening, but elaborates on nothing. It felt like it wants you to immerse yourself in a unique and complex world, but gives every setting only a few minutes of time before hopping straight to the next. For example, the training of Paul. We never see him learn how to ride the sandworm, so when he succeeds, it doesn't feel as triumphant as it would have otherwise. The Harkonnens are also much less intimidating than they were before. Most of their screentime is comprised of them trying and failing to farm spice on Arrakis, until they are defeated by Paul and the Fremen at the end without much difficulty. They should have put up more of a fight. Lastly, I know from sources that an ecological message the was very important in the book was emmited completely from the film. The Fremen speak of bringing green back to Arrakis, but that's all we ever see them do.Part of it may be a limitation of the format. If one must adapt a book full of complex lore, than either a trilogy or even a serialization may be the better option as you get more time to explain everything. I know that a third film is coming but it's not based on the same book anymore, and while I haven't read any of the books, I don't believe I should. I believe that film should stand on its own two feet, and this one does. Its legs are long and slender, with just the bare minimum of muscle required to stand, but it stands nonethelss :)",

Can't wait for more of this Saga 😊😉I was quite surprised they didn't do a weird time jump. I loved the fan intro before the film and they called it a saga, so...I'm expecting they are making more, but I heard recently, this is the last Dune film from this director sadly. I hope they take this like they did Harry Potter and keep the same style and fluidity.This film definitely had more action that the first film. They got up close and in person with it, which worked really well.Great character development which wasn't rushed. The love story played well and I'd expect they add a little more if they do a director's cut or something.Cinematography was epic like the previous film 🎥Acting was great and it was nice to see the diversity in actors.The whole design of the film with all its visuals, costumes, sound design, stunts and choreography, set design, etc., etc., were fantastic.The \"Narrating\" was done properly and not distracting.I'm honestly not sure how they can top this one.P.

    "Review Content": "I want to love this movie. Despite being in a confused state throughout the film, I enjoyed what I was seeing visually. The lack of dialogue didn't work for me, although it's an aspect that would lessen the more I learned about the characters and world. I just don't get much of a chance at that within the movie. Despite my uninvolvement of the Dune world and its characters, I still have to be honest with the faults of the script and editing.Other than the overarching plot, scenes happen rather than you being lead into scenes via an emotional journey. The first hour is a back and forth of random tests and does she like him or not. Many characters simply appear in the movie, some deep into the runtime, including a main villain who has no discernible traits other than evil for the sake of it. Some characters appear very briefly and don't do much at all. The motivation of everyone was stripped out of the script. We see an abundant amount of screen time on someone riding a worm, but large battles will abrubtly end after very little setup. Did we need a large segment of screen time involving the nukes, when we could've just been told that there's nukes? The nuke scene feels as a standout filler sequence perhaps to be overshadow a few dozen moments of filler that could've been replaced with plot.I would challenge the praisers of this film to explain why everything was perfect. Austin Butler's character was great! Why? Because he was so one dimensional? The battles are the best! You mean snippets of battles that we got and one where it was hard to tell who was who. The score was amazing! Oh, the unbelievably overused bong noise that will randomly appear in the most tepid of scenes? Even the \"twist\" ending was foreshadowed in the first few minutes. This film is all spectacle with no emotional payoff. The number one praise that people will use to describe greatness of Dune 2 is the cinematography. This should be a leg that a great movie stands on, not the foundation. Although the direction and technicality of the look of Dune 2 is epic, the writing and editing are faulty. Maybe upon rewatches I would like it more since I might understand more of the details (after getting those details from other sources), but it's still nowhere as good as it could be or as most everyone seems to think it is.",

    "Review Content": "This movie, about Paul Atreides who unites with Chani and the Fremen while seeking revenge against the conspirators who destroyed his family, is a great sequel to Dune (2021)!I had pretty high expectations because of its amazing feedback, and it sure is fantastic. I think the first movie is a masterpiece, but there are a few elements that slightly detracts my experience with Dune: Part Two. I haven't read the book, but I think the pacing and build-up are the main elements that has some flaws. The pacing frequently stumbles a bit, making it sometimes difficult to interpret what the movie tries to convey. I love all the characters themselves, but some of the characters from Dune lose a part of their values in Dune: Part Two and while the story builds up the excitement for the new characters, the way the story deals with the new characters is not deserved, especially with Emperor Shaddam Corrino IV and Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, the cousin of the protagonist, Paul Atreides. As I interpret it, it was not the Emperor who started the war, but Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, planning in the shadows. I think something is not quite right how the movie deals with the Emperor. It feels like something big is going to happen to him, but then he easily loses the battle in the third act, then becomes a prisoner to Paul, and then Feyd-Rautha loses his dual against Paul after he desires to take the Emperor's throne, which should feel like an essential part of the story. My point is, it feels like everything builds up to something but immediately gets thrown away when it faces its challenge, making it leave me with a somewhat disappointment. To add, I kind of wish there was more action and explorations of new worlds, but as said, I have not read the book, so I probably should not dare to criticize the movie too much based on the story.Anyway, the rest of the movie is incredible. I really enjoy the development of Paul from being a curious helper to a confident central figure. He still has dreams, but the more he develops, the clearer the possibilities of the future are to him. I love the way he lifts and clarifies his position among the people, making him look like a very powerful person. My favorite scene is probably when Paul walks in the crowd while he wears a cloak and the awesome score by Hans Zimmer plays in the background. Absolutely cinematic. The romance between him and Chani is nice, Stilgar is the nice touch of humor, and the transformation of the mother of Paul Atreides, Lady Jessica, is interesting. I think the connection and communication between Lady Jessica and her daughter are very compelling. It feels mysterious, and how the daughter is trying to take a part of the future is cool. Although Anya Taylor-Joy (as the daughter of Lady Jessica) only has one scene, it does much to the story. The glimpse of the eyes of Taylor-Joy just melt me, perfectly convincing me that her character is the upcoming sister of Paul. Although I think the movie slightly lacks action, the action itself is masterful. The choreography is fantastic, the visuals in general are insane, and the best of all is the sound design. Absolutely breathtaking because it proves that it is one of the most epic movies ever. Although the score doesn't take as much part of the movie as what the score from Dune does, it is still amazingly good. It is darker and rawer, making some of the elements of the movie more threatening.My complaints are only minor ones although I write much about them, but that is because they go against my high expectations. But all in all, the movie is such a great experience, especially on the big screen. No matter how much I think it will increase my enjoyment during a rewatch, I am confident that the experience will get somewhat better the second time.In conclusion, despite pacing issues and underdeveloped new characters, this movie delivers a visually stunning and thrilling experience. The movie excels in its technical aspects, boasting masterful action sequences, breathtaking visuals, and an immersive soundscape. While the story falters slightly in its execution, particularly with its portrayal of the antagonists, it effectively portrays the transformation of Paul and the intriguing development of the supporting characters, especially Lady Jessica and her daughter. Overall, the movie is a worthy sequel that builds upon the strengths of the first movie and offers a compelling cinematic experience, especially on the big screen. However, a second viewing might be necessary to fully appreciate the nuances and complexities of the movie.",

This movie gave me the chills often and was reminiscent of the original three Star Wars movies in a way. Both franchises paved the way for something entirely new, and showcase revolutionary film techniques that are sure to dazzle and inspire audiences for years to come.

    "Review Content": "I feel like I'm taking crazy pills or have missed a dose, as I cannot comprehend the high praise for this sequel.I adored Part 1, which introduced me to this trippy Sci-Fi and the grandeur of a far-flung potential future.Part 2 was all spectacle, yelling, and repetition (we get it, he's the chosen one), marred by:poor editing (I'm genuinely shocked they didn't start the film on Giedi Prime with that battle sequence. Beginning it there would have pulled us in to this weird SciFi world and made it clear that there was some horrific villain who would be a huge threat to Paul and his ambitions, instead we got a slow paced intro about returning a dead body. Dull)Lackluster pacing (yes, there's a lot to cover, but the narrative swings between too much happening and sudden lulls, or a weird build-up to a climax that kind of just happens out of nowhere - bang - and it's done).The lead, Timothee, falls short of charisma (he's genuinely trying, but he seems miscast)The romance feels totally unconvincing (almost as bad as that romance in Attack of the Clones).The villain, despite a cool appearance, lacks depth. Yes, he's psychotic and needs to constantly look up beneath a furrowed hairless brow to show us that, but he's not scary or threatening.Maybe I need to watch it again, but I was disappointed for sure, and I don't really know if it's just me missing something or if everyone's expectations of good films are being watered down, and we're forgetting that good movies get under your skin, whereas this one barely made a scratch.",

It follows the book closely, though there were some differences that will probably be addressed in the third movie.The action scenes, moreover, were spot on, with impressive shots. The movie also doesn't overdo it with its fighting scenes, having them evenly spread throughout the movie and just long enough to not tire the viewer, who would have to sit for a nearly three hour long film.The performances were, in addition, great by everyone in the all start cast.However, there were some things that were lacking. First of all, the romance wasn't convincing, with an odd pacing, and lack of chemistry between the leads.Also, there way the unborn sister was presented was tiring after a while.In addition, the movie seemed to lean more into the cinematography and impressing the audience, then focusing on the storytelling. Hence, for someone who hasn't read the book, the movie will leave them with a lot of plotholes and with one dimentional characters.So, overall, seven out of ten, because it was visually pleasing, but not mesmerizing.",

    "Review Content": "Dune 2I enjoyed it immensely!This started continuously from the first movie, and luckily I rewatched the first movie in preparation, I would suggest this is a must! Again the movie was merciless, if you had not read the books you would be lost from the start as no explanation was offered, and perhaps should go home at this point lolPart 2 of the book is about the coming true of the Arakan prophecy of a messiah that will lead the fremen to a \"green paradise\". So it is dark and religiously \"top heavy\", and so was this movie. A brooding dark serious movie with Paul and Jessica struggling with their inner demons for most of the time and tons of set piece Marshall combats. No gags here!Mr Villineuve again achieved the impossible by bringing to life this most complex of novels for the fans and it was really quite brilliant and needs to be watched numerous times.Without undermining the brilliant acting from the cast, Timothee Chalamet was outstanding in his ability to command the screen and convey we were in the presence of a messiah, he was never off the screen and it was deeply moving. The element about Paul being able to see backwards and forwards in time, whilst mentioned was not demonstrated really very effectively. Secondly, we needed more demonstration of the voice in its subtleties.There were several divergences from the book, Paul's integration into the Fremen took 3 years and Alia was born with the memories of her ancestors and excellent with a knife, this seemed to happened over a summer in the movie. Secondly Chani stands by Paul's side throughout even through a political marriage, the movie diverges from this. However Mr Villeneuve condensed the spirit of the book without diluting its impetus and Frank Herbert's intentions were respected.Perhaps more controversial, and of course it's my opinion, there was, unfortunately, to my mind, one glaring problem, there just was no on-screen chemistry between Timothee and Zendaya, it just didn't work, also her acting grated, she seemed to have attended the AB school of acting, using just 2 faces that conveyed petulance, irritation or indeed trapped wind! She just overworked most of it as if it was for TV, we all know, for movie acting \"less is more\", she looked the part, but there just was just no sexual frisson, and the accent was too american, everyone else modified their to be from \"nowhere\" exactly, so she was miscast. I have seen this actress now in Spider-Man, Euphoria and now this, she lacks thespianic skills to convey anything more than the superficial, just no heft! Florence Pugh would have made a better Chani as that lady has the skills when she's humble!I thought Austin Butler was brilliant as the evil nephew, bulked up and without eyebrows, and the teeth, it was a terrific transformation and I love it!The music was amazing throughout as were the worms and battle sequences, the CGI set a new standard in meticulous and seamingless continuity, we were there, we had a parched throat and sand in our faces, I did the sand walk back to the underground lol!This is, of course a must see, and I'm giving it a 9 outta 10, brilliant except for the romantic elements, pathetic, and passionless!",

The cast as expected is masterclass and I especially really enjoyed Bardem and Butler this time around and Denis will most likely get a best director nomination next year.Even though there is no doubt about its \"epicness\" I found it to have an even bigger pacing issue than the first one. Somewhere midway through it had me looking at my watch wondering if it is close to ending and found out that we are just grazing into the second act.The third act felt rushed and the conclusion while understandably set up for a continuation in Messiah felt really undeserving and abrupt. I would have liked to expand the third act maybe 20 more minutes just to have the movie conclude at a satisfying point rather than in the middle of the story exactly as the first one did. I might pump this up to a 9 if the next movie concludes the story in a satisfying manner.Overall a great film with many flaws that I unfortunately can't look past. It is one of the great modern sci fi's but dare I say, didn't exactly live up to the hype. See it at the biggest screen possible, 8/10.",

    "Review Date": "2024-02-26",
    "Review Content": "Rating: 9.5/10\nWatched on Feb 25th, 2024 @ Fan First Premiere event\nFormat: (Digital) IMAXIt's safe to say that Dune Part 2 is basically an expansion of Part One. More characters are added, the story is now more complex and 10x interesting with much going on, and the world of Dune is bigger.However, with lots of negativities in my opinion, the positivities are much stronger to not ruin the experience nor lower the rating.Director Denis Villeneuve proves himself again in Part Two that he is the perfect director to direct the Dune project. In addition, all the crew that helped in delivering this project truly did an accurate and amazing job to deliver this world the way it is supposed to be delivered.The VFX in this film is absolutely amazing and not noticeable expect for very few scenes that is obvious about the use of green screens but this will not ruin the experience at all. Also, the cinematography that captures Arrakis (where most of the film is held in) absolutely supports the VFX in capturing some great shots that most of them are long wide shots to capture the beautiful desert. Moreover, most of the times the characters are positioned to be in the middle of the long wide shot to capture the size of the character comparing to the world around them mostly to show off their vulnerability or their strong abilities depending in the character.The film is so much inspired by the middle eastern culture in terms of the language, clothings, production design, movements, and all the beliefs that most of the characters follow.Hans Zimmer's music is perfectly composed and really loved how in most of the fight sequences, there is no music to be played in the background making the whole attention pointed towards the fight movements which increases the nervousness and tense vibe.Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya are absolutely amazing. Paul Atreides (played by Timothée Chalamet) have reached his peak and prime level. By the end of this film, he is no longer the young Paul Atreides, he is the most powerful man in Arrakis and no one can top him nor control him. He is written with so much care that will make you recall the version that we saw in Part One and how his long journey that we experienced with him wasn't that easy. And this might be one of the greatest character studies/character development stories in cinema history, and Timothée Chalamet had a huge part in achieving that. By the end of Part Two, you will realize that Chalamet is indeed the perfect actor to portray Paul Atreides due to Chalamet's deep portraying during the different stages that his character goes through in this film and mostly moments of anger and strength on other characters. However, the real surprise is Rebecca Ferguson as her character really went through many changes in this film in which it was really shown due to Rebecca's acting. She was absolutely able to deliver the terrifying and powerful characteristics of her character Jessica. The second biggest surprise is Austin Butler as Fyed-Rautha as both his make-up design and acting was able to bring this character to screen the way it is suppose to be in the book.For the negativities:-With the same mistake that is in Dune Part One, Part Two (and the whole Dune saga) highly needs to be 'Rated R' to allow some gore, bloody, and disgusting violence scenes to be present in the film, and part Two has the perfect chance due to the amount of fight sequences specifically with Austin Butler's character, Feyd-Rautha that had epic fight sequences that were shot in Black & White and I think it's obvious the reason behind shooting them in Black & White.-Unfortunately the seriousness in this film has been lowered significantly. Especially with Javier Bardem's character Stilgar that cracks most of the jokes. What happened to Stolgar that walked in on Oscar Isaac's Duke Leto Atredius in Part One with much confident and seriousness refusing to give anything about his people?Also, Dave Batista's character Glossu Rabban is so weak in this film and we barely saw him defending himself or even being powerful which is something that does not fit with Batista's physical appearance nor the character's characteristics or the 'brutal' House Harkonnen that he represents.-(NOT A SPOILER AS IT WAS ANNOUNCED BY DIRECTOR DENIS VILLENEUVE)\nLastly, in case you didn't know, during the London premiere of Dune Part Two, actress Anya Taylor-Joy appeared at the red carpet and it was announced that the actress will be having a small surprise appearance role in the film. Can I understand why this was announced and why wasn't it kept as a surprise like it was this whole time????? Since when do actors and actresses that have a surprise role in a film appear at the red carpet premiere? This makes her appearance at the carpet very much useless and it truly ruined the surprise that was kept hidden perfectly the past few years.",

The north, and south in contrast while they all seek a leader, it's a very strong movie in that sense.The acting is top notch from EVERYONE!!! Timothee really has his movie, the second half he SHOWS his chops and wow, one of his strongest performances in my opinion.It's hard to pick out others as they are ALL so strong, his mother plays a vicious role superbly, Austin Butler is great as a crazed killer power hungry lunatic, all great.The score and visuals go without saying, Cinema experience needed for this one.I gave the first a lower score it wasn't for me, but this was great, 9/10.",

    "Review Content": "I went in blind, aware of the hype and praise but giving it a fair chance.First of all, there are some great scenes, no doubt. The first 45 minutes were pretty good.However, it is simply too long. Too long means it gets boring and monotonous, and like some astute critics have said, the problem of it lingers in the question of, \"why should I care?\". Sure, there are religious and political elements that carry truth, but ultimately they come across as cliche.Basically, you have a quasi biblical savior story here (I guess you can just compare it to Neo in the Matrix), with his journey of being the \"one\", the savior. The problem is: we've seen it all before.As much as I was immersed in the visuals and interesting and grand visual scenes, by the one hour point, u couldn't help but to check my watch and how much time was left. Then, it picked up again for fifteen minutes before becoming boring again.This will suffice as a sci fi experience, and I can see fans of the book loving it maybe, but it just lost me about halfway through. I won't deny the reviews and arguments that say part I was probably better.Masterpiece? Certain \"scenes\" scattered about it were, but overall, it is just too long and needs serious editing to be a true one.5/10.",

Because the ending of the film is perfectly well balanced and it's gives a hope of the next and the last one to come.Story, screenplay, cinematography and other aspects top of the world specially the CGI of Dune franchise is something else to witness that I've never witness before. Totally different from other films.Costumes & Visual presentation is outstanding no complaints there at all.Performance are the also one of the big surprise of the film specially TIMOTHEE CHALAMET, ZENDAYA, REBECCA FERGUSON & AUSTIN BUTLER a phenomenal performance by all of them with rest of the cast doesn't disappoint too.Dune 2 will definitely give an experience that you haven't witness specially in battle scenes the tensions that director build is just brilliant. There should be more battle scenes or those were there in the film weren't as long as the 1st part but still it's justifies the film because the story has so much to tell as you'll easily get invested into that.Overall A Complete Visual Masterpiece just like the 1st one but with more story perfection and complexities you're gonna witness in this one.A worth watch and give a IMAX experience because the visuals will just store your interest very well. A Highly Recommended...",

The dialog left something to be desired as it was at times confusing if you didn't know the story. The cinematography was excellent.All that being said, I can't for the life of me understand why the writers and directors feel in today's world that they have to change the original story line. The modifications done actually did major changes to the story in a way that made it lose continuity and not make sense in parts. The leaving out of specific caracter interactions such Pauls sister killing the Baron and Paul's ability to use the 'voice' to say nothing of skiping the whole sonic weapon storyline was crazy. Chanti's lack of support for Paul's descision to marry Emperor's daughter was weird. Chani not having a son was also strange as it played a big part in Paul's descision making.All in all the tone and storyline of the second part was as if this was a totally different movie and story from the first part.",

There isn't much in the way of day to day scenes. At 2:45 hr I don't see any way around that in 1 movie.The Chosen One motif seems well suited to cinema since it allows telling a big story while following one man, but it's definitely disconnected from reality.",

But given all the 10 of 10 ratings (making it possibly the most overrated Hollywood film this century) I just have to state the minuses.Dune: part 2 was full of long dialogue heavy scenes and too many characters and too much \"worship\" of Timothée Chalamet's character Paul. We get it.. he's the \"chosen one.\" It just came off as cliché. And Zendaya is cool, but she's not the caliber of actor that can hold a movie for 3 hours. She had RBF the entire movie.Also the build up to the bad guys dying over the last two films was a big let down. The \"uncle\" character (Baron) was awful for 2 films and he gets killed in 2 seconds. Same with his \"nephew\" (Glossu). All this time spent with them and they just fall over and die. And Christopher Walken was terribly miscast in this as the emperor. Weak character.And the sandworms. They were cool the first 5 times. But for the amount of screen time they get and they never change... it gets old after awhile.It's a good film to revisit to fall asleep too. But it other than a cool soundtrack and some great cinematography and costume design, this film doesn't really do much. Dune has proven a very difficult story to capture on film and no one has done it right yet.",

    "Review Date": "2024-03-04",
    "Review Content": "2023 was widely seen as the year the blockbuster died (I think that's hyperbolic, but let's go with it). A year with more flops than successes, a lot of audiences seemed to finally reject the endless stream of sequels, requels, and adaptations we'd gotten so accustomed to. And then, you have Dune Part II.If anything, this movie proves that it's not \"adaptation\" that's the problem. It's having a purpose to doing it. I can't think of a more relevant property (and one that deserves proper cinematic treatment) than Dune. To be clear, I haven't even read the books, only gleaming what I know about them from pop culture, but like all great adaptations, now I want to read the series.Where do I even start with Dune Part II? It's a gorgeous spectacle with richly layered characters and amazing performances; chock full of thought provoking ideas. This is a movie that reminds you why film - I'm just calling it here - is the best medium for storytelling. It combines every other aspect of art into a singular product. Visually and sonically, Dune Part II is on another level. I was lucky enough to see this thing in IMAX and it was truly worth it. Some frames look like paintings and there are gorgeous images that I'm still ruminating on a day after. The entire sequence of Geidi Prime, with the monochrome lighting, was such a perfect examples of how you can use the genre of science fiction to do something truly astounding visually. Having also recently seen Madame Web, this movie really made me appreciate great sound design and engineering.Another thing I have to highlight is the film's amazing editing. There's a lot of moving parts in this movie and a lot that apparently had to be cut. While it's not entirely perfect and some things are gleamed over (more on that later), I have to applaud the editors for making this unwieldy, massive story so digestible.But, the thing that really sets Dune Part II apart (even from its predecessors) are the characters, themes, and performances. Every character here - for the most part - is better than in the original, the mark of a great sequel. If you felt the original film felt \"cold\" and lacking in humanity, this movie is the exact opposite (not to mention the seemingly thousands of extras - although I'm sure they're mostly CG at this point). There's so much humanity here; so many relationships and ideas about people explored and enriched.Timothee Chalemet may have delivered his defining performance in this movie. His Paul Atreides perfectly conveys the complex and nuanced character he's supposed to be; a boy turned man who is torn between his sense of justice and kindess, and the reality of power. He really delivers a powerhouse of a performance here.Zendaya is also absolutely awesome in this movie. I loved the ideas and perspectives her character represented and she's entirely believable, as is her relationship with Paul. She's the best example of a female action hero; tough and competent, but not devoid of emotion or longing. Javier Bardem's Stilgar was one character who also really surprised me; he represents the Fremen who genuinely and passionately believe in Paul, yet he's never presented a \"stupid\" person or naïve. He and Zendaya's characters are thankfully, super important to the narrative.Then there's Austin Butler as Feyd Rautha. This is a performance akin to that of Colin Farrell as the Penguin; Butler completely disappears into the role and as murderous as he is, I wanted to see more of him. (Kudos to Villeneuve for having a character like this in a PG-13 film) I was also really impressed by Rebecca Ferguson as Paul's mother, Lady Jessica. Her character conflict in the first didn't really jive well with me, and I'm happy to say she's so much better in this one as a more sinister figure. Really, her decision to tie her political ambitions with her personal wishes reminded me of a less obviously evil Cersei Lannister. And, while his role isn't as big in this one, I can't get enough as Stellan Skarsgard as Vladimir Harkonnen. He's amazing and has so much screen presence.Fundamentally, Dune Part II tackles difficult questions and provides nuanced answers. It's about power and the way it manifests, and to all those who say it's essentially a repackaged \"white saviour\" trope, I feel need to improve their media literacy. Did you watch the movie? I can't think of a film that interrogates and deconstructs this idea more than this one.The movie isn't entirely perfect. I feel that especially towards the end, a lot of things were rushed through, but I understand that heading towards the end of a nearly 3 hour movie, it's hard to justify MORE content. Overall though, believe the hype. Everything about this movie is tip top: the visuals, the costumes (my God, the costumes), the editing, the sound, the acting, the writing, the choreography (I didn't even mention the myriad of amazing set pieces)...yeah, this is blockbuster filmmaking at its finest. Denis Villeneuve is the real Lisan-al Ghaib at this point.",

    "Review Date": "2024-03-05",
    "Review Content": "Dune: Part Two is the perfect example of a movie that must be seen in the cinema and not at home. The visual spectacle and design is unparalleled among sci-fi and really feels like a completely fleshed out future world (or worlds), with architecture, props and costumes that look like they were sourced from a museum rather than a Hollywood warehouse. Compared to the first film, the stakes have true gravity and the scope is much wider with far-ranging battles and conspiracies. It's hard to pinpoint any highlight as every scene is iconic, incredibly beautiful to behold and accompanied by expertly rousing music, all underscoring the central feeling of foreboding. Where would I begin? The ceremonies with the Water of Life plunge us into an ancient ritual that almost kills the drinker and reveals deep secrets that the audience only finds out in drips. Paul's terrifying vision of death and destruction (much less cheesy than in the first film) show the inner turmoil he faces as someone who is the fulcrum of the planet's destiny and resents his role but can't escape the fate set in motion by higher powers. The short scenes with the foetus are mysterious and tease at an important role to be played by her future version. Chani's frantic misgivings in the Fremen gatherings impress the deleterious effects the prophecies are having on her people and the unprecedented role of the Bene Gessarit. Princess Irulan's musings in a beautiful garden about the historical developments around her uncover just how deeply all the conspiracies extend. The scenes in the Harkonnen's world are stark and show how brutal and power-hungry they are and how formidable they can be. The actors in these scenes are perfectly cast and all impart a sense of heaviness, as if to stress just how much Spice is tied to the fate of the world, the past and the future all together. All of this combines to form an experience that immerses us in a compelling future conflict, relentlessly ratchets up in tension and constantly giving the sense that there's something even more world-shattering just around the corner.That said, the film has a few flaws that are noticeable but not substantial enough to dent my rating of 8.5/10 (rounded to 9). Some of the characterisation is caricatured - the Harkonnens are too cartoonishly evil to be believable (how many times do we need to see them murder their own staff?), Stilgar is too fanatical to be believable (how many times do we need to see him exclaim, \"the prophet! As written!!\"?), the Fremen are too invincible to be believable (did anyone ever doubt how the battles would go?) and the romance between Paul and Chani was forced. The pacing was uneven, as some scenes sped by very quickly (for example, most of the emperor's scenes), and some dragged on for no good reason (most of the times they walk or talk through the desert). Paul would have gone blind by looking directly at a nuclear explosion. The ending felt anticlimactic and was too overt in how it was setting up another sequel. Some parts of the book that are crucial to understanding the planet's history were excised, like the long-term human genetic plan and the ecological plan, which were reduced to one-line mentions. Finally, as a vexillologist, I couldn't help but notice how badly designed the flags were. One of the key principles of good flag design is simplicity, as a simple design can be recognised and remembered at a distance and when waving. Each faction has a central symbol, but their flags drown them out in a mess of visual detail, hamstringing their ability to signal at a distance and establish themselves in the audience's mind. This is a shame, as each faction has such a strong visual identity in their settings and costumes, but their symbols are not given the opportunity to shine and become iconic. Denis, if you are reading this, please hire a vexillologist!",

Every moment was spellbinding, the cinematography epic, the acting authentic, and the world building was astonishing.They made changes form the book, sure, but the changes they made fit in with the tone of the narrative. Zendaya's Chani is strong yet feminine, and you feel both her growth and her struggle throughout the film. Timothée Chalamet shines as Paul, he conveys a quiet strength throughout the film, and you believe his struggles as well as his ascent to leadership, he earns it and owns it. The rest of the cast brings their best to the film, every character feels well lived-in.The film is truly visually breathtaking, so many wonderful directing choices. I love that Villeneuve allows us to linger in scenes, to extend the feeling of each world as you visit them. You feel like you have a sense for the Dune universe simply though the visual and sound spaces.Hollywood, this is what we want. Heroic Masculine and Feminine characters, good writing and pacing, authenticity. This is how you do it right, Dune should be a guidebook for the rest of the industry.",

    "Review Title": "Powerful, visceral filmmaking",
    "Review Date": "2024-03-02",
    "Review Content": "This was an utterly fabulous cinematic and spiritual experience. I was drawn into Villeneuve's world by the enormous scale of the design, the undeniable pull of a religious fable, the conviction of the lead players and the power of the sound and visual design.It's strange how often critics (pro or amateur) think that sound and visuals are somehow a mere adjunct to the story; that celebrity actors must all have something worthy to do (cameos are derided); that the politics of casting must be taken into account; that all old stories must have a modern take to make them relevant.Cinema IS moving pictures, and whilst sound is not a requirement, even \"silent\" era classics made good use of music and effects. Story is important, but cinema's unique power is its capacity to move an audience by engaging two of our senses in a most primeval way. Story alone cannot do this.Admittedly, one's hearing does feel at risk at times, but without the awesome sound design, Dune: Part Two would be diminished. I was emotionally overwhelmed by the power of the movie's visceral delivery. This was not some sentimental response to the tale, but a gut reaction to the physical transmission of the themes of power, corruption, revenge, faith, identity - the spiritual battle of Good and Evil. These were, for me, of greater significance than the mere political struggle between the two Houses and the Emperor., which is, in any case, subordinate to the power wielded by the Benegesserit which the Reverend Mothers themselves recognise is not supreme.However, if you want to see parallels with contemporary issues such as the problems of living in a post-imperial world, they are still very visible, and the \"romance\" between Paul and Chani is not a romance at all, burdened as it is with the visions and portents of a Messianic future.I should add that I am neither a fan of the books, having read barely 100 pages of the first, nor, as an atheist, do I adhere to any religious faith. I am, however, a believer in the power of cinema.",

    "Review Content": "Denis Villeneuve proves once again for being one of the greatest filmmakers of our time with Dune Part 2 being possibly his greatest movie so far.Dune Part 2 is everything you want for a sequel. It's bigger, boulder and slightly better than its predecessor. This movie concludes the first movie in a very satisfying way as you keep rooting for Paul in his revenge quest and rise to power.This movie has more action scenes, explosions and violence than the first film but keeps the same tone in the world building, mysticism and grounded character moments.Visually and technically this movie is masterpiece.There are some scenes that will stay with you even after the credits roll, wanting to go see the film again just to relive the spectacle you just witnessed (those who've seen it, you know which scenes I'm talking about...). CGI is also used sparingly just to amplify the screenplay in large scenes.Direction and writing of this movie is top notch and satisfying for the viewer. The movie creates tension in the beginning and peaks strongly towards the end (unlike Oppenheimer). There are no pacing issues.Storywise the movie succeeds in the message its trying to deliver thanks to the cast and especially Timothée Calamet's strong performance. I was worried that Paul Atreides' journey of becoming the chosen \"jihad messiah\" would not be believable at all, given the main actors young age. To my surprise this was all done very well and Timothée Calamet managed to shift his characters personality in a drastic way, which made him seem like a totally different person at the end, the kind of fanatic leader the masses would follow. This is partly for the credit of the rest of the cast that genuinely seem to worship and uplift the young man to power.However, there are some minor faults in this movie but only minor since the movie could have been even better and elevated into perfection with only a few fixes in my opinion.Firstly, the events of the movie and planet Arrakis are supposed to control the fate of the entire universe. Sadly the film doesn't make us feel this intergalactic conflict since it focuses only on the two houses, Harkonnen and Atreides. Events take place mainly on Arrakis and the world isn't expanded much. This could've been fixed with just extra 5 - 10 minutes by showing us a few different planets, cultures and other great houses reacting to the conflict or talking about it in some manner. Sadly we dont have a director's cut to show us what could've been.Secondly, the movie feels somewhat one dimensional because of the interplay of the story and the music. Although fantastic, Hans Zimmer's score is quite loud and pushes the audience to feel the \"epicness\" \"darkness\" and sense of \"doom\" to the point of exhaustion throughout the 3 hour runtime. There aren't enough calm and beautiful moments and gentle musical pieces to balance out these emotions, other than a few between Chani and Paul.Other movies of this genre (e.g. Star Wars, Interstellar) manage to evoke many different emotions throughout the film. But since this movie is mainly about revenge, power and conquest the score suits the plot well. But in the end the movie evokes only one kind of emotion with its themes and music to complement it. This could've been fixed with maybe revisiting Paul's early family life in flashbacks or something else that's tonally different to the main feel of the movie. For these reasons I must say I felt a sleight sense of emptiness after leaving the theatre.Despite these few critiques, the movie succeeds on every front and brings home the main theme of revenge and justice in a very satisfying way for the audience and concludes the setup in the first installment very well. Dune Part 2 is an epic visual masterpiece and will remain as one of the greatest Sci-fi films of this generation.Rating: 8,3 stars.",

    "Review Date": "2024-03-01",
    "Review Content": "Dune 2 is a big screen action/adventure spectacle the likes of which hasn't been seen since, well, maybe the first Dune in 2021. But when it comes to paying off what the original effort set up so perfectly, this sophomore sequel doesn't quite hit it out of the park.For a very basic overview, Dune 2 picks up with Paul (Timothee Chalamet) and mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) living amongst the Fremen after House Atreides being all but wiped out in the House Harkonnen collaboration with the Emperor's army to re-take Arrakis. Though Jessica and Stilgar (Javier Bardem) continue to tout Paul as the mythical prophesized messiah per the Bene Gesserit religious sect, Paul isn't yet convinced-nor are other Fremen like Chani (Zendaya). Will Paul accept the mantle and risk all-out religious war-or choose to remain embedded \"locally\" with the Fremen? Meanwhile, Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard) is struggling to control spice production on Arrakis, so unhinged nephew Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler) is called in for assistance. Finally, the Emperor (Christopher Walken) and Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh) scheme to keep themselves in power over all of the machinations.There is absolutely no doubt that Dune 2 is cinema spectacle of the highest order. Director Denis Villeneuve composes a film that should be seen in the biggest format possible (to truly appreciate the scale) and within the best sound structure (Dolby Atmos for me and it was theater-rumbling!). There is never a dull moment from beginning to end-always something interesting to look at or immerse yourself in on screen.Here's the issue with Dune 2: the first film was one of the best world-building setups I've ever seen in a flick. It expertly dropped viewers into the planetary conflict, gradually built up the key characters, and imbued it all with a sense of great mystery and intrigue. While this sequel technically pays off all those setups, it doesn't always do so in the most satisfying or understandable of ways. I won't go into every nook and cranny here, but a few examples:-Paul resists his messianic calling the entire film-until the end when he just \"gives in\"?-The fetus within Jessica is talking to her and will someday grow up to be Anya Taylor-Joy's brief cameo character?-Even after Paul accepts his mantle-the Houses won't acknowledge him?-The bombshell of Paul's more-diverse-than-we-realized bloodline came off as anticlimactic, especially considering how it immediately becomes the driving force of the film's endgame.I know that there is an answer to every question posed above-but none of it felt all that satisfactory or revelatory to me. Part of the problem could be that I was expecting more of a definitive ending and received a \"setting up a franchise\" denouement instead. A particularly telling observation was how my favorite character in the entire movie was Butler's Feyd-Rautha. Why? Because-like in Dune 1-it was something completely different/new and shrouded in mystery that Villeneuve was able to unwind.So, in my final reckoning of Dune 2, the visual spectacle and star-studded cast do most of the heavy-lifting. If you don't see this one from a theater seat at least once, you are doing yourself a disservice. But if you are looking for a plot-tight, perfectly character-fulfilling narrative, you may walk away a little disappointed (at least compared to the first Villeneuve Dune).",

Dialogues are often over filled with high fantasy terms and nomenclatures which I'm sure will lose the audience many times before you understand you don't actually need to understand what they mean to get the bigger picture.Casting is probably one of the greatest I have ever seen with many having just a few lines of dialogues and/or not feeling invested in the characters they are portraying.I can't stand Bautista to be the main villain for the first part of such a movie...Just to be replaced by a random dude with no charm that does a badass show-off for 5 minutes and become our tier S final boss.World wants Villeneuve to be the new Peter Jackson so hard with articles and adv everywhere over the Net calling it the new 'Empire Strikes Back' but this Dune is a poor contender when put in comparison to any Lord of the Rings.",

I have to say even though I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, it fell short of what I expected and definitely didn't come close to what we saw in the first movie. With that being said, I have to give a massive props to the whole team for not letting us down. It's not easy to pull off a sequel that closely match up to the first.One thing I appreciate about this series is the marriage between nature, science and spirituality. It is just so beautifully done. You can't pinpoint exactly what era they are in, there's amazing technology, yet there's also amazing spirituality yet they still live in complete unison with nature. It's perfect. Also the dialogue is just like music to my ears. It's not these washed up forced humor we see in most Marvel/DC movies. This was some intelligent, matured dialogue and I respect them for doing that. One thing I felt wasn't necessary was the fuss between Paul and Chani. They could have spared us all that childish drama. It just didn't fit esp for someone like the Messiah.I totally loved the coming of age of Paul, it was so powerful. I loved the transformation of his mother into the Reverend Mother. I loved seeing Gurney back in the mix. It was a lovely reunion. I was quite disappointed in the Emperor. He looked so weak and his capture was laughable. But to see the Baron, his nephew and Glossu all killed was a very bold move. I honestly can't imagine what they have in store now for us in the third installation.Overall, this was a good movie, not as great as the first but it's up there with the best.",

This movie does absolutely everything better. Maybe my favourite part of the movie, the soundtrack was phenomenal. It might very well be hans zimmers best.Fantastic preformances from the entire A list cast. Timothee chalamet proves yet again what a versatile actor he is, undoubtedly one of the best of the next generation. But the star preformance of the movie was definitely Austin butler. The cinematography was breathtaking even for Denis vilneuve. It wouldn't be ridiculous to say this might be the best sci fi ever. 10/10.",

Music was sublime, and definitely a step up even from the masterwork that Hans Zimmer cooked up for the first part. Acting was impeccable from the whole cast, the action scenes were a joy to behold, and the CGI is simply on par with the best looking films out there. It is an instant classic, and Denis Villeneuve deserves all the plaudits he will inevitably receive, alongside the incredible crew of course! Definitely one for the big screen, unmissable, and a truly unforgettable experience... Timothée Chalamet is a revelation in this film, his acting is simply incredible, he fills every single scene he is in to its absolute brim with his presence. Rebecca Fergus on, Zendaya and Javier Bardem are also an absolute delight to watch. Having watched the Part 1 reissue a couple of weeks back meant I was up to date and I could enjoy the plot to the fullest. I shall be starting with the books soon enough and I already can't wait for the following film. Mr. Villeneuve, I sincerely feel like you spoiled us with this film. Bravo.",

    "Review Content": "I read the first 3 Dune books about 15 years ago, I was a pretty big Dune dork back in the day, but then my interest waned and life got in the way. So I'd say my POV is somewhere between a mega Dune fan, and the general audience who doesn't know anything about the books. Zoom forward to 2021 and though I was excited for Part 1, I wasn't blown away by it (though I must admit I've enjoyed Part 1 more and more each time I've watched it). I went into Part 2 more curious than excited, but my gosh was I surprised by how much I enjoyed it!! I was running a little late to my showtime, and didn't get a chance to use the restroom before. I kept waiting for a \"slow\" or boring scene to sneak out--and that scene never came. Every moment felt important, and each scene held my attention so completely, that I decided the discomfort of needing to void wasn't worth missing a beat. So I guess it's rather silly to tell you all to use the restroom before, but learn from my mistakes! Dune Part 2 is mesmerizing, beautiful and heartbreaking all at once. It's been a really long time since I've had such a visceral reaction to a movie; I kept thinking to myself, \"the movies are back!!\" And even though it's long, by the end I was actually sad because I wanted more...although at least I could finally pee! ;)",

    "Review Date": "2024-03-01",
    "Review Content": "Being a long time fan of Dune, and the books by Frank Herbert, I left Dune: Part Two with a sense of confusion at what I had just watched.Denis Villeneuve did a phenomenal job with Dune: Part One, hands down, no question. He stayed as true as possible to the original story with very few, albeit minor changes from the novel. The reasons behind this were understandable; deliver Frank Herbert's \"Dune\" in a manner that modern audiences could digest and walk away from understanding and appreciating what they had just experienced.Dune: Part Two arrives; critics and influencers alike are toting the film as a \"masterclass of filmmaking\" and \"best science fiction movie of all time to date\".I am fair and give credit where credit is due. The characters and their execution of their roles were flawless, the cinematography was awe-inspiring, the action was jaw-dropping, and the musical scoring was outstanding setting every mood and tone perfectly.So, why six stars? The story. Hands down, the story.There are creative liberties taken by Villeneuve that I believe hurts the original material. Many of these liberties are easily identified in the film by \"holy crap!\" moments, and the *GASP* moments in the film. Granted, while, once again, masterfully executed, they accomplished exactly what it felt like they were meant to do - get shock value. Whether these changes were studio decisions, or Villeneuve's, remains to be seen.Had Villeneuve followed his original formula from Dune: Part One into Dune: Part Two, following the narrative from Frank Herbert's original works, I still think this film would have impressed beyond measure. Unfortunately, in its release state, I believe Dune: Part Two fails the audience by robbing them of the true experience that is Dune - the story.This is how I felt leaving the theater; let down. Is it a visually stunning and well executed movie? Yes. Is it true to the source material? No.I leave viewers, enthusiasts, and fans of the original novels a fair observation and warning. If you want to see an amazing movie, you will be pleased. If you are going for the story - be prepared.",

The perfect set up movie for the ultimate showdown and the growth of a boy into a man and from a man into a Messiah. Chalamet does a superb job in growing not only as an actor but as man becoming himself and learning the ways of the world. Please go see Part 2 as quickly as possible and in IMAX. This movie deserves to go down as one of, if not the greatest sci-fi movie of all time. IMAX IMAX IMAX.",

But I also liked Austin Butler has Feyd, he really brings the insanity of the character to life, such a scene stealer every time he's on camera.

The shots, the music, the sound design are all top notch.I still find myself baffled by these movies. Again, I am the super ultimate target audience for weird sci fi stuff, and I love most of Denis Villanueve's work, even with all of the whiz bang taking place in Dune2, I still found myself yawning at times. I can't keep track of any of the characters names, I have only a basic understanding of who is doing what, I am not mesmerised by Timothee Chalamet nor Zendaya's acting. They both seem kind of wooden to me. Also, by about the 17th or 18th time they push in for a super close up on Zendaya's weird face and linger there for what seemed like hours on end, I began to grow weary.I don't know, I think I must be the problem. Everyone else in the world seems to love these same movies, so I must be some sort of freak or miscreant.To me this is an amped up version of the first Dune.

    "Review Date": "2024-03-03",
    "Review Content": "Dune, part two definitely is impressive visually with a great musical score. The sound effects alone are remarkable and very loud specially watching it at Dolby Theatre.And that's about it, really! The overall plot was lacking big time, without spoiling anything its strongly based on prophecy and leadership, it's very similar to many of the well known historical stories of prophets and their messages, their rise to leadership and power. Unlike history however, the story buildup is weak, the script lacks originality and the whole ( he is the one ! ) scenario have been utilized so many times in films ( for eg, the Matrix ).There are no high stakes, whether or not the protagonist is the One has no major consequences or at least the script failed to highlight it.The movie still has some very solid moments, like the introduction of the main villain with the black and white scenes is fantastic. In fact, the scenes with Villains were more amusing than the protagonists.Acting is decent but nothing spectacular, Zendaya has basically the same angry impression throughout without any clear reason why. She needs to train and work harder on her skills.Timothee Chalamant, is slightly better, but not very impressive. Dave Bautista is under utilized and both his character and Chalamant's scream too much, it's distracting.Speaking of loud, there was also plenty of shouting from the villagers ( i think they are called Fremen ), chanting words like Lasan Algaib and Modeb, these two words probably consumed half the script, repeated over and over, it is exhausting.I know the director wanted to reflect some authenticity with the languages, but the frequent shifting between English and Fremen or whatever its called was another distraction.Probably the chemistry between Zendaya and Chalamant are the worst I've ever seen, i am not sure if its their acting or the script, but it felt forced and predictable.As mentioned earlier, musical score and sounds effects are the highlight of the movie, superb and transfers you into the film as if we are in it. Same with the visuals, the color gradient and atmosphere sucks you into the world of Dune, its such an experience! But after a while, one wants a story arc to keep ones interest high, which lacked.I would probably say the costume design department is the best, definitely impressive style and unique costume designs for almost all characters, could be nominated for best costume design.Action scenes were loud and impressive but lacked tension because as I mentioned there are no high stakes for our protagonist losing. Not to mention, battle scenes are brief and felt rushed. I was expecting epic battles with strategies and action sequences, something like Star Wars or Lord of the Rings, but there is no emphasis or focus on the battle scenes, specifically the final battle scene.So yeah, it is ok with some memorable scenes, but left me generally disappointed and I think its over hyped, I do recall liking the first movie more. It could have at least be shorter than 2 hours 45 minutes or some better choreography and tension in battles scenes. A little less emphasis on the prophecy angle.",

    "Review Content": "This sprawling, potent sequel is a high water mark in science fiction filmmaking. Paul Atreides (Chalamet) has joined forces with the Fremen whose advance continues over disintegrating armies. Paul is viewed by some Fremen as a foreigner but by others as a savior. He himself regards their faith as mere folklore even as his mother Lady Jessica (Ferguson) ascends to the position of Reverend Mother. But eventually Paul watches his own moral code and ethics erode as he rises to the position of ruler. This part of the film accentuates the weakening of principles as power accumulates.The cinematography in this film is overpowering. From one grand spectacle to the next, Villeneuve meets and surpasses expectations. Austin Butler makes an impression as the elite gladiaor-villain, Feyd-Rautha. Chalamet shines in this film but even he is ultimately overtaken by Zendaya as Chani, who is her own force of energy in this film and a righteous voice that does not bend with the masses. Hans Zimmer's electric score amplifies the tension, dread and wonder that dots this chapter. From breathtaking combat scenes to more intimate moments, the film is multi-faceted and riveting. Few sequels outshine the original. This one does and cements the trilogy as having made its mark. Highly recommended to all viewers, without exception.",

Gorgeous cinematography, exceptional sound, great performances, phenomenal battle scenes, political intrigue and manipulation, religious symbolism, you name it it's there, and all done brilliantly. I enjoyed Part one but this is on entirely different level.You don't need to have seen part one to enjoy this, it can be viewed as a standalone film in its own right. Of course if you have seen part one some elements will be that much easier to grasp. It's a testament to Villeneuve that he has pulled that off without any flashbacks retelling of anything in part one and make it completely understandable to a new viewer.Some of the set pieces are astounding, and my internal cheerleader was whooping silently in my head on a number of occasions. On a couple of occasions I resisted the temptation, to stand up and cheer. It's extremely rare for any film to make me feel that way no matter how good.Timothy Chalamet has never been better, his performance totally befitting the part of Paul.The studio were right to delay release so the cast could promote it. It deserves to be seen by a wide audience and not just sci-fi fans and the cast and crew should be rightly proud of the achievement, a sold out theatre in the middle of a weekday afternoon tells you everything. If you make a movie as good as this the cinema is the best place to see it. Don't wait see it now.I believe that we will loomnack on this in years to come and it will be regularly included in lists of all-time classics.",

    "Review Content": "Dune Part Two is the sequel to the first Dune film by director Denis Villeneuve, which was released in 2021. Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) has now joined the Fremen group. Here he tries to learn about their customs such as their handling of the sandworms. Paul seeks revenge on the conspirators who destroyed his family. With Chani (Zendaya) at his side, Paul goes into battle against enemy troops who serve the Emperor (Christopher Walken). This sequel, three years later, immediately picks up where the first part ended. This first part was well received by most as an improved start to the film adaptations of the Dune story. Previous film adaptations turned out less well, because the story of the Dune books is quite a large and complicated story. With Denis Villeneuve's first part he managed to properly introduce the Dune world and build it up with the political struggle between the different groups. With this second film he focuses more on the customs and beliefs of the Fremen group, who think they can defeat the enemy through a more religious approach. Furthermore, the relationship between Paul and Chani is also developed a bit more, but there are some rushed moments. However, with this second part, many things have to be explained and built upon, which means that there are some long-winded moments in this second part. Compared to the first part, this second part has more room for action scenes, which increases the pace and tension slightly. Furthermore, it remains more of a political battle between different groups and houses, which fight each other more strategically than really physically. In contrast to the first part, things in this second part feel more rushed. Like the relationship between Paul and Chani. The aspect of the earthworms and how the Fremen handle and ride the creatures is also explained in a somewhat hasty manner, so it is not always clear. Denis Villeneuve once again provides beautiful visual images of the different worlds and areas from the Dune books. Together with photography director Greig Fraser, they ensure that the images appear beautiful, creative and credible. By adapting the Dune story from the first book of the series into two films, Denis Villeneuve has given himself and his cast members more space to make something good and beautiful out of the film adaptation. This also gives the actors more space to develop their characters and evolve with the time they get in the films. Timothée Chalamet is thus given the opportunity to develop his character from an exploring newcomer into someone who tries to avenge the harm done to his family. Furthermore, he tries to be a savior for the different groups and tries to get them back into balance. Compared to the first part, Zendaya is given more time and space in this second part to develop her character more and work on the chemistry and relationship she has with Timothée Chalamet, his character. However, this relationship can seem a bit rushed, which means it cannot always remain so believable for every viewer. Of the new cast members, Austin Butler steals the most scenes as a dangerous warrior of the enemy army, but he and his character could have been given a little more time and development. Other well-known actors such as Josh Brolin, Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken play their roles well and appropriately, but unfortunately do not have such major roles in this second Dune film.",

    "Review Content": "This is certainly a great looking film to see on a big screen with some really effective, almost industrially sounding, audio - but what happened to the story? It's wafer thin and really stretched out for 2¾ hours. We pick up with \"Paul\" (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother (Rebecca Ferguson) trying to convince the \"Fremen\" that they are worth the hassle. Fortunately, leader \"Stilgar\" (Javier Bardem) is convinced of the messianic state of the young refugee, whilst their own reverend mother is on her last legs which might give \"Jessica\" a chance to prove her own worth, and provide an opportunity to peddle some embellished mythology about her son's ascendant propheteering. All of this manoeuvring and politicking is having quite an impact on \"Chani\" (the under-used Zendaya) and on the relationship between her and the increasingly worshipped new Duke. Meantime, now fully reinvigorated and emerged from his bath of recuperative Guinness, the evil \"Baron Harkonnen\" (an almost Zeppelin-like Stellan Skarsgård) has recruited his lethal nephew \"Feyd-Rautha\" (Austin Butler) to get to grips with the rebellion on \"Arrakis\" that is bringing him into the gaze of an ill-satisfied emperor (Christopher Walken). Battle lines are drawn! Now whilst I did enjoy this, the rest of the film is a gloriously photographed but slowly paced hybrid of \"Khartoum\" (1966) and \"Lawrence of Arabia\" (1962) with a bit of the \"Phantom Menace\" (1999) thrown in for good measure. The acting is adequate but the characterisations are all too routinely sacrificed at the altar of the stunning visuals and from about an hour to go, I was convinced this this was but part two of three (or maybe even more). Walken and Charlotte Rampling feature all too sparingly to make much difference, indeed even Zendaya's warrior-like tendencies seem to have been neutered rather and I though that Chalamet just tried far too hard to imbue his character with a strength that he was far more successful with first time round. That said, it does work well enough as a classy and well produced sci-fi adventure with plenty of action and mysticism but I needed more meat on it's bones. I still get distinctly squeamish when I watch what they do with the water, let alone where they get it from!!",

Ugly, infinitely evil, sexually perverted. Is that really serious? A good villain should have motivation that is understandable to the viewer.The score is incredibly intrusive. Sometimes you sense a few seconds earlier that a roaring and pounding noise is about to flood the cinema. This is too much.The film actually has an excellent cast.

    "Review Content": "Dune: Part Two,\" despite its ambitious attempt to continue the epic saga, falls significantly short of the expectations set by its predecessor, leaving much to be desired in both narrative depth and character development. Where Denis Villeneuve's first installment offered a visually stunning and philosophically rich entrance into the universe of Frank Herbert's iconic series, this sequel struggles to maintain that momentum, veering into the realm of cinematic redundancy and superficial spectacle.The film's pacing is one of its most glaring issues. It oscillates between rushed sequences that skim over crucial plot points and tedious stretches where little of consequence happens. This erratic tempo not only disrupts the narrative flow but also undermines the story's emotional weight, leaving the audience disengaged from what should be high-stakes moments.Character development, or the lack thereof, further detracts from the film's appeal. Newcomers to the cast are introduced with great fanfare but are given scant screen time to evolve beyond one-dimensional figures. This oversight is particularly disappointing given the rich backstories and intricate personalities that define Herbert's characters. Even returning characters, who were previously portrayed with depth and complexity, are reduced to mere shadows of their former selves, often acting out of character or being pushed to the sidelines.Visually, \"Dune: Part Two\" continues to impress with its breathtaking landscapes and meticulous attention to detail in costume and production design. However, these aesthetic achievements cannot compensate for the film's narrative shortcomings. The reliance on CGI spectacle over substantive storytelling feels like a missed opportunity to explore the novel's themes of power, ecology, and human nature.Moreover, the script seems to struggle with balancing the source material's dense political intrigue with the need for blockbuster action sequences. As a result, much of the film's potential for thoughtful commentary on imperialism and environmentalism is lost in translation, replaced by generic battle scenes that lack the emotional resonance seen in the first film.In conclusion, \"Dune: Part Two\" is a visually captivating but ultimately unsatisfying continuation of the Dune saga. Its failure to capitalize on the groundwork laid by its predecessor results in a sequel that feels both overloaded and superficial. While die-hard fans may find moments to enjoy, those seeking the depth and nuance of the original will likely be left wanting more. This sequel, unfortunately, suggests that in attempting to broaden its appeal, the franchise has sacrificed the very elements that made it distinctive and compelling in the first place.",

Not only follow up the story but surpass it. Which this movie definitely achieved.Every actor and actress nailed their roles. It's acted to perfection, has breathtaking visuals, the soundtrack is amazing.It's a prefect recipe for a blockbuster. But apart from that it also has a really good storyline with themes such as consequences of war, prophecies and hope. And what it does to a man. Timothee Chalamet absolutely nailed the role of Paul Atreidies.I was grinning through the entirety of the last 40 minutes. After so many attempts of mediocrity we finally have a movie that does justice to Frank Herbert's work and space opera genre.",

    "Review Content": "I see some people recommending to watch it on the largest screen possible. I agree with them and that's why I decided to go to the Leonberg IMAX cinema in Germany. The largest IMAX screen worldwide. On top of that, one of the VFX supervisors, Gerd Nefzer was there as a special guest. It was an experience I will never forget. The whole theater was shaking during action scenes with intense sound. And of course the movie itself is a masterpiece. It's also significantly better than the first movie. Dune Part 2 is solid proof that good cinema exists and can continue to exist, if the studio executives can give artists a break and allow the creative freedom necessary for such a result.",

    "Review Content": "5 out of 5 stars.Dune Part 2 is an awesome science fiction epic that delivers the next chapter in the series and it is one exciting cinematic experience. The director does an amazing job planning every sequence and action. Plus the visual effects are astonishing. Director Denis Villeneuve is one of the best as he plans every scene carefully and making each sequence a cinematic epic from fantastic cinematography that does great capturing the visuals and set pieces. The script is also incredible which continues with the story and world building. More new characters are introduced. Characters go through an arc. The pacing is fast. The film also felt like a middle chapter with a cliffhanger ending while tying up loose ends. Definitely excited to see another Dune 3 film by Denis Villenueve.The cast ensemble did a great job with there performances. The music score by Hans Zimmer was beautiful. The visual effects are amazing with breathtaking set pieces. The sandworms showing up in the climatic battle was epic that needs to be seen on the biggest screen. There is more action than the first. Better pacing. And more of an epic story. This is one of best films of the year. I cant wait for Dune 3.",

    "Review Date": "2024-02-28",
    "Review Content": "I liked the overall pacing of things much better in the first part. I can compare pretty well because I watched the first part night before the second part. First half is filled with dialogue, then second half is very rushed. Ironically, I think this movie works much better on small screen than on IMAX, where I saw this. Just because there is so much dialogue and actually not that much of visually impressive scenes which would work better on IMAX.Feels like they used the time in less important places. Sardukan are suddenly poor cannon fodder instead of empires finest fighters. Paul and his savvy mates taking suddenly harvesters with gadgets they just suddenly happen to have. Nothing is explained via moving pictures. Not anything like how they organize the strikes against Harkonen or how they happen to have weapons of different variety and so on. Things just happen. Suddenly just because it's conventional Paul walks to different places without virtually any kind of resistance or drama just so that he can convey some lines which should be meaningful for the viewer. As it was in the first part, they don't really show the view of Harkonens. I liked the dynamic between the Harkonen baron and Rabban in the first movie, even though that they did gave very little of time for that side of the story in the first part, but they give even less time in this movie.I expected at least something to really stand out in a production of this scale but nothing really stands out. Not writing, not actor performances, not music, nothing. The movie is kind of nice to see how things developed from the first part but that's pretty much it. That's why for me this movie is 6/10.",

    "Review Content": "What a stunning piece of cinema. If you could create a new genre named 'sophisticated Sci-Fi' then this would be top of the rankings.After Dune Part One, I was hopeful, expectant but a little apprehensive as to what was coming next. Despite the incredible cinematography, the first film was quite slow going and convoluted in setting up the premise. However, I needn't have worried as part two was a much simpler premise setting up the Paul Atreides' revenge story, but also gave so much action, drama and moment of pure tension. Austin Butler's psychotic portrayal of Feyd-Rautha stole the show but there were also excellent turns from Chalamet, Zendaya and the who's who of Hollywood.What is clear is that Villeneuve does scale better than any of his peers, and when the worms take front and centre in some of the biggest scenes, he showsbwhynhe is a master of his art. It really is a film that deserves to be on the big screen and showed once more why we should savour our cinemas before it's too late.",

    "Review Content": "Awarding 10/10s, for me, are given only to the likes of Empire Strikes Back, Return of the King, or Raiders of the Lost Ark .... it truly must be great. So to get to the 10 plateau in my critiques reflects a certain quality and value within my little bubble of love for movies. The recent (say last 7 or 8 years) output from the industry has been worse (much worse) than lack-luster, most of the the \"tent pole block busters\" have been cinematic garbage (see for example, The Marvels and as far back as The Last Jedi, basically most anything from Disney but certainly not exclusive to Disney) .Here we have a movie created by a team free of the DEI quotas and agenda driven malarkey and they have produced nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece!!! Probably the best science fiction movie of the decade, ranking it up there with one of the best sequels ever constructed (if you can call it that ... it feels more like the second half of a very long movie). Every aspect of this movie, from the cinematography, to the directing, writing, acting, CGI, sound, score... it is spot on perfect. The amount of talent that went into this movie shows and the end product is a breath of fresh air in an otherwise decaying industry poisoned by toxic one-sided politics, nearly dead and left to rot. I was truly emotional at the end, tears running down my face, not so much moved by the story (which was excellent) but having finally witnessed a truly great movie after years of absolute garbage, the emotion stirred in me was one of relief, a calming repose that great movie making has not been completely killed off and that it is still possible to make a movie that is not promoting \"the message\" or clubbing me over the head with a bunch of nonsense.",

    "Review Title": "Real Modern Classic, Thank You Denis.",
    "Review Date": "2024-03-04",
    "Review Content": "I believe I've witnessed something magnificent, and truly, it shouldn't be watched outside of the IMAX format because regardless of what anyone says, this is a modern classic. I'm writing this review somewhat for myself because years later, when I read it again, I want to see how much I elevated this legend and how it managed to close so many things correctly despite its mini flaws.For the past two days, the film hasn't left my mind, and the reason I give it a perfect 10 is this. Whenever I talk about the film, I get excited because I've seen a visual masterpiece. It has incredible cinematography, beyond amazing. Watching the Lisan al Gaib scene where the Fremen walk from a bird's eye view, the scene between Paul and Feyd at the end, the scene where the Fremen accept Paul, the Harkonnen attack in the opening sequence, and many others, you feel that there are very few scenes like these. Greig Fraser is a master at this. Besides that, Hans Zimmer's music, which doesn't mean much when listened to alone but reaches a tremendous dimension with the sound mixing, adds a whole new dimension to the film. It's truly wonderfully designed and fitted, Denis, you're amazing.And the casting is phenomenal. Dave, Timothée, Florence, Zendaya, Rebecca, Javier, Josh, Austin, they're all fantastic. I won't describe each one separately, saying 'this scene was superb,' everyone fits their role so well and performs so excellently that the film becomes a recital; there isn't a single scene with amateurish or shallow acting. Besides acting, something that needs to be mentioned is the stunts. The fight choreography was quite good and clear, especially the scene between Feyd and Paul at the end, where the music stops and we watch pure fighting for a few minutes, it was wonderful.Besides the cinematography, casting and harmony, the legendary use and synchronization of music, there are two more reasons why this film excels and why I rate it highly. Firstly, the film is superbly adapted, I won't touch upon this further. Secondly, it's a fantastic critique film.The film critiques every mundane and inherent aspect of human nature. Whether it's the dynastic system, coercion around the secret gene preservation logic, the exploitation of religion, political chaos, inefficient use of resources, and many more points, it hits the bullseye so accurately that it's both overwhelming and not tiring while making you feel it, a tremendous achievement.Now, onto the contentious topic of staying faithful to the books and the polemic of how similar it was... Despite everything, it's said that both Part 1 and Part 2 were quite faithful to the book, and I believe they were. Some details might have been skipped or not exactly replicated in the second film, but for such a meta and philosophical book series, this is extremely normal; if everything were portrayed exactly, it might have been incomprehensible. I won't comment on the film's dynasty and operation right now because as a sequel, it has to complete the script with good motivation and also convey the characters it portrays well; I'm very happy it achieved this.The film had a fitting humor, some scenes were mildly funny and unintentionally successful, which was admirable. Also, I think it will sweep the awards at the Oscars next year; it could win for its amazing costumes, production design, adapted screenplay, and maybe even best picture.It's the peak of cinema that I've ever seen; go to IMAX, you won't regret it. I didn't delve into the details because everyone should watch it for themselves and try to interpret it in their own way; it's that kind of film.\"May thy knife chip & shatter.\" March 2024.",

    "Review Date": "2024-02-27",
    "Review Content": "I'd suggest revisiting the first movie because this sequel picks up right where we left off in the Dune universe. From the beginning, you're thrust back into the chaotic, unpredictable, and perilous world of Arrakis. The action is swift and meticulously planned, keeping you engaged from start to finish. What I appreciated about the first film carries over seamlessly into the sequel. Despite being a sci-fi movie, it doesn't feel like one; even without the sci-fi action and special effects, it remains a compelling, immersive, and grounded storytelling experience. Clocking in at 2 hours and 40 odd minutes, the movie flies by, with not a single wasted moment. The narrative flows effortlessly, maintaining organized chaos and hitting all the necessary beats along the way. Given that it's a sequel, you might expect a drop-off, but that's simply not the case. Every actor on screen, from Timothy and Zendaya to Josh Brolin and Austin Butler, along with the other talented individuals, delivered exceptional performances. Each of them was on point and effectively brought the story to life. Another standout aspect is Hans Zimmer's score. Each note propels the narrative with intent, effectively enhancing the atmosphere of every scene. Zimmer's mastery is evident in his ability to employ the same theme across various emotional contexts. While we've heard the theme repeatedly, this film allows us to experience it in different emotional nuances, depending on the on-screen events. While it's still early in 2024, this film should definitely be considered an Oscar contender next year. Dune part 2 effectively concludes the first of six books in the expansive Dune saga. Part of me is eager to see the next installment on screen, but if this marks the end, I'm good with that too, considering the saga gets a little weird from here. A big thank you to AMC Theatres and WB for the opportunity to experience this in IMAX tonight. I highly recommend a premium format because the immersive sound truly enhances the viewing experience. I'm already looking forward to watching this again. Great flick!",

    "Review Title": "Dune: Part Two\" - A Cinematic Odyssey of Love, Revenge, and Cosmic Destiny",
    "Review Date": "2024-03-01",
    "Review Content": "Dune: Part Two\" invites audiences into a mesmerizing narrative universe, mixing the stories of love, revenge, and fate of the main protagonist, Paul Atreides. The film emerged not just as a sequel but as an immersive cinematic experience, marrying the incredible visual and deep narrative. The opening scenes alone show the grandeur element of the movie where the vastness of the desert is captured in wide shots and breathtaking cinematography.The combination of the talented Denis Villeneuve as the director and Greig Fraser as the cinematographer becomes apparent and results in a visual masterpiece. The imagery is not just a backdrop but a character in its own right, shaping the emotional landscape of the film. One standout scene unfolds when Paul Atreides, played by the exceptional Timotthe Chalamet, confronts the ruins of his ancestral home. That scene alone serves as a poignant visual metaphor for the shattered remains of the legacy that his family built for decades. Chalamet has proven himself to be an actor with depth and serious talent that transcends across the big screen. Chalamet masterfully navigates his character's journey from vulnerability to a determination to reclaim what was lost, setting the tone for the overarching themes of resilience and revenge.The narration of religion becomes palpable in a pivotal scene where Paul grapples with prophetic visions. The sequence masterfully blends visual effects with Hans Zimmer's haunting and captivating score which creates an atmosphere that is fueled with mysticism. The film effectively balances organized religion with an exploration of mystical elements embedded in Frank Herbert's material. One of the film's most visually arresting moments occurs during a Fremen sandworm hunt. The usage of CGI effects is a testament to the film's commitment to pushing the boundaries of visual storytelling. As the movie progresses and the characters navigate through the desert terrain, each frame not only showcases the film's technical achievement but also propels the narrative forward, underscoring the symbiotic relationship between spectacle and powerful storytelling.One of the highlights of the movie is Rebecca Ferguson's portrayal of Lady Jessica which contributes a layer of complexity to the story. In one particular scene where she imparts wisdom to Paul, Ferguson infuses the character with such maternal gravity that adds layers and depth to their relationship. Her nuanced performance coupled with the rich character development, anchor the film in emotional authenticity. Javier Bardem and Dave Bautista also deliver a memorable performance as Stilgar and Rabban, respectively. In a scene where Stilgar confronts Paul about his intentions with the Fremen, Bardem's commanding presence underscores the tension between the native inhabitants and the newcomers. Bautista's Rabban, a brutal enforcer, exudes menace, creating a palpable sense of threat that permeates the narrative.Austin Butler, Florence Pugh, Josh Brolin, and Charlotte Rampling, contributed to the film's complex story. With their performances that are convincing and commanding, some scenes featuring their characters added layers to the story which resulted in a web of relationships that enriches the narrative.The richness of the movie's theme extends to a sequence that explores the balance of romance and broader narrative. As Paul and Chani, played wonderfully by Zendaya, unfold and navigate through their relationship, explore the film's complexities of love amidst a backdrop of political intrigue and impending war. The romance, initially presented as the focal, seamlessly marries with the overarching themes of religion and fate.The culmination of these narrative threads is evident in climactic battle scenes that pit Fremen against formidable adversaries. The scene choreography of the action sequences, accompanied by the film's impeccable visuals, results in a visceral and intense cinematic experience. The stakes are high, and the film successfully maintains tension without sacrificing its commitment to visual grandeur. The combination of visuals and storytelling is perhaps the most evident in a scene where Paul faces a moral dilemma. The interplay of light and shadow, coupled with Zimmer's evocative score, added the emotional weight of the moment. The film's ability to balance spectacle with substance underscores its place not only as a visual feast but also as a powerhouse in storytelling.As the film progresses, the story embraces the philosophical underpinnings of Herbert's source material. In a scene where Paul contemplates his role as a potential messiah, the film delves into questions of destiny, free will, and the consequences of wielding immense power. This exploration adds intellectual depth to the narrative, inviting audiences to ponder the implications of Paul's journey. The film's final act also delivers a direct resolution that is both satisfying and open-ended. As Paul fights with the consequences of his choices, the movie leaves room for contemplation. In a scene where Paul confronts the complexities of leadership, Timothee Chalamet's performance captures the weight of his character's innate responsibility.In conclusion, \"Dune: Part Two\" transcends the confines of traditional sequels, standing as a testament to the potential of cinema as an art form. The marriage of breathtaking visuals, masterful storytelling, and nuanced performances creates a cinematic experience that resonates on multiple levels. The film's exploration of love, revenge, religion, and destiny unfolds within a visual landscape that is as captivating as it is thought-provoking. Denis Villeneuve's magnum opus, \"Dune: Part Two\" sets a new standard for cinematic excellence, leaving an enduring legacy in the annals of film history.",

    "Review Date": "2024-03-02",
    "Review Content": "I enjoyed Dune (2021) but it definitely felt like mostly setup and world-building. It even ends right when things are about to get interesting. Does Dune Part 2 deliver on all the setup?Short answer, Yes! The story is incredibly engaging and thought-provoking. What makes Dune so special is that it isn't just a typical revenge or good vs evil or chosen hero-type story. There is more to everything, with very creative dilemmas that our main character has. It does have the typical romance story in the first act but it is handled wonderfully and then used with great effectiveness afterwards. The second and third acts are just phenomenal storytelling. The director, Denis Villeneuve, just pulls you into this world and manages to deliver an emotional rollercoaster experience that will mesmerize you.On that note, every actor is amazing. Timothée Chalamet had to convince the audience that his character was becoming a frightening leader in part 2 and he absolutes excels. Zendaya is great and has excellent chemistry with Timothée which makes their character's romance believable. Javier returns with more of a substantial role and he is magnificent. He provides some levity to a very dark story but does it naturally compared to the forced humour that is thanks to MCU movies. In terms of newcomers, Austin Butler gives a very top-notch psychotic performance as Feyd. He felt like a frightening presence. Additionally, Christopher Walken is a crazy casting for the Emperor but he absolutely works. All the returning actors continue to deliver terrific performances, and newcomers such as Florence are excellent additions.Part 2 also has a lot more action set pieces. These sequences are a lot better than the first movie as they are choreographed and shot more clearly. The 3rd act has a very entertaining sequence and the final fight itself is an epic way to end. Greig Fraser returns as the cinematographer and he might be one of the best since Roger Deakins. Every shot is just beautiful and really captures the world of Dune perfectly. Hans Zimmer also returns and he delivers more or less the same epic music score as the first film. The set design is still gorgeous and the costumes are still as wonderful as ever.I only have minor nitpicks and that is the movie can feel a bit fast at times. This is notable during the first act where it sort of breezes over Paul's initial time with the Fremen. I also kind of wished the Emperor and Princess Irulan had more appearances considering their vital roles. The character Thufir Hawat from Dune (2021) is also nowhere to be seen in part 2 despite his fate being unclear from the first film. I honestly wouldn't have minded if this film had 15 more minutes to add these additional scenes.Overall, it is rare for a sequel to be this good but Dune Part 2 is one of the best sequels. It delivers on everything the first movie setup while also being a stellar Sci-Fi film. Denis Villeneuve is one of my favourite modern directors and I hope he gets to make that final Dune movie that he wants. I know I will 100% be there to watch it if it happens!",

Acclimating with the Desert people, he continues his path to acceptance and revenge whilst her mom, is pushed for deity-ship as the new reverend mother.Its biggest strength is that it is a visual feast. Every moment is a painting vibe. Deneuve knows how to frame his shot and elegantly present it to the audience.Personally, not my film though. Its a bit dense for a Dune normie like me. This truly felt like you actually need to watch Dune Part One again and relearn stuff. AND, I hated that this film was written to be more of an actual 2hr 45min interlude to the third film. It was not a film that can stand on its own EVEN with the knowledge you had if you watched the first part.I also felt that this came off intensely slow (not well paced) and overlong. The action would only peak for 10 mins towards the end AND its barely a climax in fact. A lot of the characters in this film are fodder (ie Butler and Pugh) and could have been edited out of it, and it would still make sense. Butler is definitely overhyped for how little/barebone his role is. Zendaya and Chalamet took the biggest chunk of the film but still felt underwritten - that's a testament given how long the film feels. The religious cult storyline faired better but I felt that it could have been more subtle and organically ingrained into the story rather than driven into dialogue.Overall, just not my cup of tea. I think its overhyped.",

Denis Villeneuve has delivered a follow-up that amplifies every breathtaking aspect of its predecessor.The sheer scope of this movie is awe-inspiring. The world of Arrakis unfolds with such meticulous detail and grand scale that you feel fully immersed in this alien yet starkly beautiful setting. The visual effects are nothing short of mind-blowing; from the majesty of the colossal sandworms to the intricate spectacle of futuristic battles, each frame is a masterclass in cinematic artistry.But it's not just a visual feast. The story in \"Part Two\" takes a bolder, more complex turn. The political intrigue intensifies, the stakes feel impossibly high, and the depths of Paul Atreides' destiny are plumbed in ways that are both thrilling and deeply thought-provoking. While the film is grand and epic, it skillfully balances spectacle with profound character moments and a plot laden with themes of prophecy, power, and the consequences of choice.If you were a fan of the first \"Dune,\" prepare to be blown away. If you're a lover of cinema itself, this film is an absolute must-see.",

Timothee Chalamet, Zendaya, Javier Bardem, Rebecca Ferguson, Austin Butler, Stella Skarsgard, Florence Pugh, Josh Brolin, Dave Bautista and last but not the least Christopher Walken were Fantastic.Dune Part 1 and Part 2 will be remembered as most Spectacular Sci-Fi Action, Adventure, War, Drama Films in the history.Waiting for next one from the Novel Dune: Messiah!!!!This movie Deserves 10/10 in all aspects.",

    "Review Content": "I think there are so many things to talk about this movie so let's keep it \"simple\". This film is absolutely incredible, it's a masterpiece, a work of art. Besides that I think this is also one of the most important films ever made. It accomplishes so much on so many levels. For example, when was the last time we saw a science-fiction movie with masterclass acting, deep characters, perfect cinematography, immaculate sound design (the list could go on...) and that is adapted from a novel?! But more specifically, I believe this film showed us the true power of CGI and how to use it properly. It was nearly invisible and it blended perfectly with the rest of the footage. Denis Villeneuve just took us somehwere no one had never been and it truly is an undescribable experience. He made a perfect use of wide shots, lenses and filters. Adding to that is the immaculate sound design. Hans Zimmer yet again makes an incredible original score and Villeneuve compliments it with the perfect background noises. One thing is for sure though, this is a movie to see in theatre. For me, this was the best theatre experience ever. So if you can go see it I highly recommend to go see it before it leaves to go into streaming.",

I can't remember the last time I experienced so many spine-tingling moments from truly astounding scenery and cinematography, harrowing depth and gravitas, immersive action sequences, and epic Fremen dialogue.After so many years of being lectured by hollywood with poor scripts and miscast actors, Dune is a welcome reminder that all is not lost. Hopefully film studios take note and realise what happens when you trust a director and his team to understand source material and do their best to accurately put it on the big screen (although I will say that it wasn't 100% accurate).In summary, amazing movie. Go watch it.",

    "Review Content": "Dune: Part Two is intelligent blockbuster filmmaking at its finest. An epic tragedy told on the biggest canvas imaginable with every department operating in unison and at the top of their game. The first Dune may have focused on the set-up but that doesn't mean this one is rushing straight into the action, maintaining that immersive slow burning nature.Timothée Chalamet got a nice journey in the original, however this one is so much bigger. He plays the internal conflict so well as he tries his best to avoid his destiny and by the end he feels like a different person entirely in a way that doesn't come out of nowhere. In those earlier moments he also displays palpable chemistry with Zendaya as they begin to truly connect.As well as having that strong chemistry with Chalamet, Zendaya is given so much more to do here (as promised), essentially becoming co-lead. As the film descends further in its climactic moments, she remains the only one who's able to see through the manipulation that's happening with a fair few moments where her looks of frustration say everything.There are so many huge names in this cast that don't get much in an impactful way. All of them are fully committed to their smaller parts with Austin Butler being a major highlight. The film describes him as psychotic and honestly that's putting it mildly. His deliberate impersonation of the Baron really works to make him even more unsettling.It's clear from its first major action sequence, bathed in a beautiful orange hue, that director Denis Villeneuve is a master of the craft at this point. Even compared to Part One, the scale of this chapter is immense with returning cinematographer Greig Fraser bringing his specific set of skills to make this an undeniable cinematic event.Considering how good his previous score was, Hans Zimmer could've easily coasted for this one by just reusing all of those themes but it's obvious that he wouldn't do that because he clearly loves playing in this sandbox. Almost every transcendent piece from last time is still present and there's new ones that are equally memorable.",

    "Review Content": "Dune Part II is visually spectacular and Timothy Chalamet has grown into quite a gifted actor. The worm riding is everything you hoped it would be and there's no way this doesn't win the Oscar for Cinematography and Special Effects and Sound. But the real star of this story is Paul Atreides and our focus rightly stays there. A wonderfully complex character, and any fan of the books knows that Paul is not quite hero, not quite messiah and not quite villian. A tall order for a young actor but Timothy Chalamet \"commands the stage\" and finally someone plays Paul Atreides with the nuance Herbert wrote in him. Credit must go to the director too who clearly guided his actors to find the performance within and most all of the characters live up to Herbert's vision and Villeneuve's interpretation. I say almost because I did not care for the direction they took Chani's character and we are robbed of the years spent together and instead Chani and Paul are reduced to teen angst. Gone is their son and his sister remains unborn forcing us into a very short timeline where we are to believe a LOT happens within the length of a pregnancy. We are robbed of some of the details of Fremen culture but that said, it was still wonderful. I was glad Jamis' wife was written out so there were good changes. Zendaya does a pretty good job and she's charming on screen but this was a pretty flat performance mostly because they didn't allow her to be Chani from the book. I also still don't care for Rebecca Ferguson's Lady Jessica. I loved this actress in White Queen but you can tell she didn't do her research and read the books (as she so often brags on late night TV). To me the character is so much bigger in the books. Ferguson plays her with one note. But back to positive - I loved Javier Bardem as Stilgar although he was arguably a touch too Zealot, Josh Brolin's Gurney Halek was perfection but too little music from him. And Austin Butler's Feyd-Rautha?! What a wonderful surprise! That kid has range! The final knife fight was choreographic beauty.I would give it a 10 but I think they should have spent a little more time on Fremen culture but I suppose a Spice Orgy would be difficult for 2024. All in all I loved it! Well done! Can't wait for Dune Messiah.",

I read the first book soon after as to immerse myself in knowing what would happen next and to have a better knowledge of the universe. At the time in my mind the first part missed out on some things that I felt were important in establishing the overall story, however after watching the second part I understand what Denis Villeneuve's vision cinematically needed to go a slightly different direction. The battles in the second part were epic and all of the added stuff of Paul training was a fun experience. I'm sad to see the whole story arc of Thufir Hawat as well as Paul's child and his bizarre sister being dropped, but I understand that when it comes to adapting a novel to the big screen that some things aren't as necessary/needed to build for future installments. I loved this movie, it was such a great sequel and is helping further the vision of Frank Herbert.",

A Part 3 is of course necessary but until we get one, it's a duo. And then it fits perfectly: Part One is 1.5 acts of the story and we're left with a dazzling display of intensity.Hans Zimmer continues what he many times referred to as a project that is really close to him, and it shows. After releasing additional 2 albums full of almost 4 hours of music besides the official Dune Part One soundtrack, he continues his quest for the true soul of Dune (in my opinion) - the music.Which leads me to my next point: you HAVE TO watch it in IMAX. It will blow you away. My popcorn box was literally vibrated by the bass, and some parts of the film were so visually stunning that I was quite literally jaw dropped.Without giving anything away, Dune Part 2 is just magnificent.",

    "Review Title": "Extraordinary filmmaking and most certainly Villeneuve's magnum opus",
    "Review Date": "2024-03-01",
    "Review Content": "The first \"Dune\" was an exceptional film for a largely exposition-based narrative that told half of the story of the main book. It combined the best qualities of both blockbuster spectacle filmmaking and more character driven-style filmmaking for a brilliantly made piece of cinema. But \"Dune\" fans know that the story only gets more compelling as it goes on, and Denis Villeneuve managed to top himself once again. \"Dune: Part Two\" is nothing less than an absolute masterpiece that not only manages to top the first installment in just about every way.The film picks up pretty much exactly where the first film left off, where Paul has just joined the Fremen to try to fulfill his ultimate goal to defeat the Harkonnens and bring peace to Arrakis. As can be expected, the performances are uniformly excellent among the large ensemble cast, and most characters that were in both this film and its predecessor improve on their performance and its character arc and associated range in comparison to the previous film. Timothee Chalamet is gripping as Paul, showing a dynamic emotional core. The same can be said for Zendaya as Chani and Rebecca Ferguson as Jessica. Austin Butler is chillingly menacing as the vicious Feyd-Rautha. The film is absolutely impeccable from an aesthetic standpoint, from the cinematography to Hans Zimmer's score to the superbly detailed production design based on Fremen culture. Scenes such as Paul riding a sandworm are simply awe-inspiring on an excellent premium large format screen. But the most important thing is that the film is so in tune to the themes and character arcs unique to the second half of the story, particularly Paul's insistence that he is a messianic figure, Jessica's support of that notion in large part due to her Bene Gesserit ways, and Chani's refusal of that view and her independence while still being loyal to the Fremen at large. Villeneuve has always been an insightful and character-driven storyteller first through the lens of science fiction, and the nuanced portrayal of those themes is what elevates this film to the next level. Perfectly paced at 2 hours and 46 minutes, the film does an excellent job at portraying the complexity of the book and its characters; and I generally thought that the changes made from the book (and there are a few notable ones) served their purposes and ultimately still contributed to an outstanding film.Like the very best films, \"Dune: Part Two\" further broadens our horizons as to what cinema can be. In this case, it does so by showing that blockbuster sequels can be exceptionally dedicated to thoughtful thematic complexity complemented by thorough character development. These elements contribute so much to the film as a whole, and help make it an unforgettable cinematic experience.Not to be missed. 10/10.Note: I saw the film in Dolby Cinema, and as can be expected, the picture and sound quality were both superb. You could really feel the impact of the score and other sounds, which further improved the viewing experience.",

I do wish Denis left in the ecology bits but I understand runtime had to be kept to a reasonable length. Ending was changed to be more female empowering than the book I guess. Chani overall was a bit more independent and less \"submissive.\" In the book Chani accepts some \"traditional\" gender roles while in the movie it clear that Chani is never subservient to Paul. I knew they would \"update\" the story for today's society so the changes expected.",

    "Review Content": "Dune: Part Two is one of the best produced films I have ever seen. The cinematography, casting, direction and special effects are all phenomenal. The filmmakers have paid intricate attention to detail and it shows throughout the movie.The film follows two strong-willed lovers who are among the many fighters on the planet Arrakis. Paul wants to destroy the people who killed his family, but foresees a dangerous future. That same force is messing with his mind and may ruin his plan to save their people.Some of your favorite actors are in Dune: Part Two! The main characters are Paul or Uzul (Timothée Chalamet), Chani (Zendaya), Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), Stilgar (Javier Bardem), Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler), Beast Rabban (Dave Bautista) and Emperor (Christopher Walken). The casting is fantastic; each actor compliments their characters beautifully and believably. I felt many emotions while watching it because of the great acting. When Chani is hurt by Uzul's sudden change of mind, the air feels tense and her anger is shown. Also, Uzul's mom, Jessica, is mysterious and changes her personality when she drinks the poison. This film is so well-produced. I am beyond amazed by the quality of the production. The camerawork captures the scenes so well, especially when they are in the desert. The special effects are mind-blowing, like when Uzul and Chani blow up multiple helicopters. The machine they are running from looks incredibly realistic and threatening. When Uzul has visions, the special effects are well-displayed. We learn that, by consuming Spice, the people on Arrakis can see the future. You know when they are seeing the future because their eyes turn blue. This film exceeds all my expectations and explores science fiction beautifully. The pacing is perhaps a bit off, but you might expect some slow parts since it is nearly three hours long! A lot of hard work went into creating this film. I highly recommend watching Dune: Part One to understand the concepts, the characters and their backstories. Dune: Part 2 picks up right where Dune: Part One left off. These two films really bring the Dune books to life. I applaud the director, Denis Villeneuve, for creating such admirable work. My favorite part of the film is when Paul (or Uzul) learns to ride a huge sandworm. The special effects are remarkable because you feel as if you are on the sandworm with him - the wind rushes, the sand flies everywhere, and the motion of the sandworm is smooth. It looks incredibly realistic and it shows how far CGI has come.The film's message is to have hope and to always believe it can happen. Paul's hope carries him throughout his fights and he constantly encourages the others to believe that they can do it. He also tells his mother to not give them false hope over a prophecy. Be aware that this film has mature concepts, a lot of violence, profanity, and bloody scenes.I give Dune: Part Two 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults. Dune: Part Two releases in theaters March 1, 2024. By Sydney S., KIDS FIRST!",

The sheer scale of the film, its world-building, mythology, geo-political intricacies, and overall meticulous approach left a lasting impression on me. Naturally, my anticipation for \"Dune: Part Two\" was high, and now that it's here, the question looms: \"Does it hold up well against the first?\"Well, as you might have guessed from my title, my answer is a resounding 'yes'. It delivers everything one could have hoped for from a Dune sequel, leaving no room for disappointment. The elements that made the first movie so special are present here in just the right amounts-never overdone nor toned down. With visually spectacular scenes, amazing cinematography, elaborately majestic set pieces, intricate costume designs, an epic soundtrack, and captivating action choreography, the film is a must-watch in cinemas.It's one of those rare movies that truly justifies a trip to the cinemas, and as far as Dune is concerned, it may be the last installment for a while, given that Part 3 is not expected anytime soon. If you've seen the first part, make sure not to miss the second in theaters. And if you haven't seen the first part yet, watch it now and ensure you catch the second installment in theaters.",

It's a visual and auditory explosion of beauty and the technical aspects are all pristine. Directing, cinematography and music are elite. And they continue to build the cast with great new additions.But just like with Part One, the lack of story progression is noticeable. We don't get the ups and downs of a three-act structure. It feels like one act stretched out to 165 minutes. Again we don't seem to really have a climax. I didn't feel the emotional resonance or investment in the story and characters. And I didn't entirely grasp character motivations, like why a character does something or why another is upset about it.With Part One, I was a lot more forgiving of it not being able to completely stand on its own. But now it's getting a little frustrating. Also, the PG-13 limitations are glaring.(1 viewing, early fan screening IMAX 2/25/2024)",

    "Review Content": "Denis Villeneuve delivers nothing short of a monumental achievement in science-fiction filmmaking, and the best adaption of Frank Herbert's Dune up to date. The world is captivating, the visual effects and the production design are flawless. Greig Fraser's breath taking Cinematography, accompanied by Zimmer's sumptuous musical score bring you into the story of the madness of conquest and the power of belief.Filled with breathtaking images, stunning action, it's a story that transcends it's genre. A story that is dense as the world of Dune remains intriguingly complex, full of characters whose roles shift and evolve. And even if it may take five and a half hours for his character to truly come to life, two films in, Chalamet's evolution as Paul gives everything a center. His subdued yet compelling performance serves the thematic ambiguity of Paul's character well. Zendaya gets more screen time then in the first film, but for me the standout performance came from Rebecca Ferguson. During this film I truly understood why she was best cast for this role. Javier Bardem further enriches the ensemble cast.The best new addition to the crew is Austin Butler as the baron's bald-pated, hyper vicious nephew. As for Florence Pugh, even if her character is only getting a certain amount of screen time amidst Dune: Part Two's cast of returning characters, her impact could not be seen as minimal, setting the scene for further character development. Other newer characters like Lady Margot remain a bit more unexplored.In our age of ever-increasing runtimes, it's a rare achievement that the film's 166-minute length feels really earned. But I do wish it had even more EVEN MORE run time, to allow more time for the most uncomfortable emotions to linger on in some scenes.Ultimately, Dune: Part Two is a grand entertainment that also sustains the main ideas of Frank Herbert's novel, exploring the dark aspects around religion, politics, power and violence. Absolute sensory overload. This must be seen on the biggest screen possible, with IMAX being almost like a chief's kiss. If Dune: Part 1 didn't make you a believer; Part 2 just might.Cannot wait for Dune Messiah for us to have the complete trilogy, in the vison of the masterful director Denis Villeneuve.",

And that' where Dune part 2 prevails. Dune shows the importance of proper writing, tight screenplay and visuals done right.Cinematography specially in third act of the movie shows the scale of Greig fraser and that scale is unimaginable. Crisp editing, brilliant score by the Hans Zimmer are cherry on the top.Rebecca Furguson and Zendaya have given a performance of life time. Javier Burdem's performance as Stalgir seems to be funny in first phase of the movie, A faithful servant of the holy folks told about the messiah but as the movie goes by it slowly converts into the horror and that where Javier Bordem and josh brolin's Act seems legit and strong.Austin butler is madness, he shown his peak in those entry sequences.There are no words that are enough to explain the Timothee chalamat as messiah of fremen. Timothee as Paul Atredis is the best casting that has took place. That shift from a hopeful prince to fearful leader of cult is Amazing.Denis Villineuve is a brilliant director.

The Atmosphere was Brilliant in that scene and I Loved the Sound in that Scene.This is a Review of the Film.Let's Start With the Performances.1. Rebecca Ferguson - Lady Jessica. Rebecca was and is Always on top of her Game, Great Performance.2. Timothy Chalamet - Paul Atreides. He's Very Good and has this Speech near the End and he's Firing on all Cylinders In that Speech. A Stand Out Moment From Him.3. Zendaya - Chani. Zendaya Expands more in this Performance as she was in Very Little of Dune Part 1. She had an Excellent Narrative Purpose too in a Certain Scene.4. Lea Seydoux - Margot Fenring, Outstanding Performance. Such a Good Segment with Feyd Rautha, in Dolby Cinema, this Segments' Sound was Amazing.5. Austin Butler - Feyd Rautha, Brutal Performance by him.6. Florence Pugh - Princess Irulan, she was good, I wanted to see a bit more of her though.7. Christopher Walken - Shaddam IV, disappointing. Maybe we will see more of him in The 3RD.8. Javier Bardem - Stilgar, Stellan Skarsgard - Baron Harkonnen, Josh Brolin - Gurney, Dave Bautista - Rabban Harkonnen. All are Good.🎬 The Direction and Vision, on top of the Performances, the Moments that needed to be Dramatic were executed Effectively, and the Moments that Needed to be Strong, were indeed so.🏅Dunes Lore is So Rich and the World Building and Everything it Contains is Very Interesting. That Silver Ball Ship Looked Amazing. And there's Multiple other Bits of the Lore that are Great to see.📜 A Narrative That is Constantly Flowing and on the Move, it's so Good.💐 The Visuals are Stunning to Watch at Times.💥 The Action Scenes and Worm Riding were Loud and Bustling.🎵 The Score Fits the Film Perfectly.Overall, Another Rich Entry in this Soon to Be Trilogy.",

One of my first thoughts coming out of the theater was how it compared to empire strikes back. I mean could this have been better? Maybe. It certainly gave me more goosebumps. It was more visually stunning and had a soundtrack that while not as iconic, certainly feels more true to the atmosphere of the movie. It had been a long time since a sci-fi made me forget I was watching a movie. The movie has three strengths: the beginning, the middle, and the end. Although the beginning and end were definitely my favorite. Now I'm just crying thinking about waiting for part three.",

With a runtime of 2 hours and 46 minutes, you can easily see that not a single second was wasted. Sound design was a key factor as it produced such an immersive experience, feeling every single bit of bass in the seats. Visually this film was spectacular thanks to some stunning cinematography. The cast was phenomenal, providing some of their best performances to date and can easily see some Oscar nominations incoming. Especially when it comes to Austin Butler stealing the show taking on the role of Feyd-Rautha, one of the best villain performances in a while. To top that all off, Hans Zimmer continues to prove he is one of the greatest composers of all time with such a powerful and emotional score. \"Dune: Part Two\" is an easy reminder as to why I love films so much and Denis Villeneuve blessed us with such a beautiful and powerful cinematic experience.",

It's a visual treat with superb special effects throughout, from the grandness of the beautiful desert to the harshness and contrast of the Harkonnen style. The plot covers religious fervor, mature romance and intergalactic conquest with a good balance and the cast of actors are great, truly bringing the story to life. The musical score intensifies every scene and whilst it could have been paced better, what with a slow-ish start and a seemingly compacted final act, I was entertained throughout.Score for Dune Part Two = 9/10.",

    "Review Content": "Dune: Part Two\" has all the elements to make the amazing cinema experience. When you watch this film, you can really dig into the world, feel it, almost touch it, could I say. It have all of the things we need, tragedy, action, and of course a little bit of humor from time to time. The first film (Dune: Part One) was definitely an overrated average film that I can't say I enjoyed to much. It didn't felt complete, had many lacks and unfinished details in the story, and the action was generally speaking really boring. Now the sequel, was on a way different level, and it's really rare to say that a sequel is better than the original, but in this case it is true. The plot goes straight after the first one, continuing the battle for the injustice of this dark and cruel world. New characters, enemies, secrets to be revealed, and everything has to end with one word: War. I can start to say how much this film feels like reality. In Dune, the people dealing with the problems on their planets, feels exactly how the wars, revolutions and aspects humanity had over centuries. This film couldn't show it any better. Including some real prophecy stuff involved here, I almost felt Timothée Chalamet was the walking Jesus talking for the good, besides that Jesus didn't master martial arts or any fighting technics of some sort🙂 The character development was also a strong part of the plot, and the characters felt much more important to me that before. The first hour of \"Dune: Part Two\" were Paul Atreides was teached the way of being a Fremen (The Desert People) felt almost to me like \"Avatar: The Way of Water\" when the forest people had to learn from the water people to survive in the new place. I felt the reference was strong here, but not if it was a bad thing, of course. Now jumping over to the technicals and camera, that I think carried a big part of the film, really the atmosphere. The camera filming, usage of the shadows and light, as well as the very interesting angles, smooth montage, and epic editing with the amazing music score, couldn't have made it more of a cinematic experience. They had some very interesting ideas of showing things, for example a baby inside a mother's stomach, and such graphic illusion of that I have never seen before. The runtime was good, and I didn't really felt bored, I was entertained all the time, and I can't wait to see the sequel: \"Dune: Part Three\", that will debut after some years. So concluding, yes, you should watch this, it was much better than the first one, and it is an experience you are going to remember!",

The movie shows how belief is the biggest weapon humanity can wield and also the scariest if used inappropriately. The acting from Timothée is fantastic. You really see him grow into this character the Lisan Al-Gaib. There were a few acting performances that did not hit par but on the whole, this is a mega movie and a true box-office beast. I do wonder whether the oscars would try and allow this big budget blockbusters play a more prominent role in awards season.",

Chani and Paul's relationship didn't seem believable and it just appeared. There was no build up, and too much comedy (?!!) there were people laughing in the cinema when I went, I didnt go to watch a comedy and the apparent funny bits shoukd have been left out.

This was a passion project for Denis Villenueve, and it shows.If you're looking for a casual movie experience that is easy to digest, this is not the movie for you. This movie, just like the first one, doesn't spoon feed you anything. It requires attention and application to be fully appreciated. Luckily, it's a really easy movie to pay attention to because of how intense and epic it is.Some of the changes that were made from the book were a little disappointing to me, but they were clearly necessary and I could tell that they were made with love and a true and deep understanding of the source material. Making a book-accurate Alia had the potential to ruin the tone of the entire movie. Also, even though I think baby Leto's death would have packed a powerful punch and been helpful to inform Paul's choices, it was rendered impossible with the decision to condense the timeline. After watching it, I honestly don't think that it could have been done much better than it was.",

I expect the film will do to Films what the Books originally did. Its a master class. It there is any thing to criticize, is the jumps in the story from time to time... But it doesnt matter...because the blanks get filled in. Just like a torture scene or love scene where, not everything is shown... Ur imagination is allowed to do the rest.

    "Review Content": "In so many ways, Dune: Part 2 is all you could ever ask for from a big screen spectacle with an added bonus that this visual feast and sensory shattering blockbuster has the heart and soul to match, making director Denis Villeneuve's and his casts return to the sand clad world of Arrakis one that will not soon be forgotten in the history of the cinematic medium.A victim of last years Hollywood strikes, which saw Villeneuve's much anticipated follow-up to his beloved first entry from 2021 get moved from a late 2023 roll-out to its end of Feb release this year, Part 2 is well and truly worth the extra wait eager cinemagoers have had to endure with this eye-popping epic as good of a reason as there has ever been to get off your couch and give your home cinema a well-deserved break to get out and see what Villeneuve has in store for you, with what can only be described as the quintessential example of what can be delivered on the big screen format.From the haunting beauty of the unforgiving plains of Arrakis (aka Abu Dhabi) where Paul and his new Fremen friends wander, the almost rollercoaster like experience of sandworm riding, the black and white majesty and horror of our first trip to the Harkonnen owned planet of Giedi Prime, the stunningly staged battles both externally and internally through to the unforgettable world building of Hans Zimmer's instantly iconic score, Part 2 is an all-round success that builds on what was special about Part 1 and enhances it at all times.Throughout this technical marvel we are also treated to the official arrival of the next stage of the already memorable career of lead Timothée Chalamet, who here brings Paul Atreides's journey from meek boy to what many see as a life-changing messiah sent to save them from the oppressiveness they have felt for ages gone by in a fashion that is awards worthy.It's a career-defining performance from Chalamet, it's been sometime since I can recall seeing such growth and screen presence come to life before our eyes but its more and more evident in Part 2 as the films never dull close to three hour runtime moves forward with Villeneuve and his cast never wasting a single second of screentime on anything that feels like excess baggage or unwarranted diversions, this is a film with a singular vision that never panders down to its audience and treats its material with a respect and reverence that can proudly sit alongside the likes of The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and the original Star Wars trilogy for world building, creation and characters being sprung to life.Arriving at a time in the history of cinema where debates are raging about the future viability and even keenness from audiences to support the world of move-making on a grand-scale, Part 2 can be looked at much like Paul Atreides is seen by the blue-eyed faithful that watch his every move, a messiah of sorts coming along to remind us all of what the possibilities are, all delivered by the grand puppet master that is Denis Villeneuve who has here, without question or debate, marked himself down as one of the all-time great filmmakers.Across the span of just over a decade, the French Canadian mastermind has managed a set of films that are up there with as good of a run as we've ever seen with 2010's Incendies starting a run of Prisoners, Enemy, Sicario, Arrival, Blade Runner 2049, Dune: Part 1 and now Dune: Part 2. 8 incredible films that show no signs of slowing down anytime soon and we as audience members should be happy to be witnesses and partakers in such a career that could be this generations defining one alongside Christopher Nolan.With everyone and everything at the top of their game, from Rebecca Ferguson's noteworthy turn as Lady Jessica, Austin Butler's scene-stealing villain Feyd-Rautha, cinematographer Greig Fraser's masterful camerawork, Jacqueline West's costume design and art direction and set decoration that puts most Hollywood productions to shame, Part 2 is as alive as a film could be, a Sci-Fi masterpiece that in turn bares witness to blockbuster entertainment can and should be, making Part 2 the very definition of a must-see cinema spectacle.Final Say -Upping the game in every facet, Dune: Part 2 is the perfect progression of the already great Part 1, gifting us a chance to enjoy a feast for the senses like very few films have provided us over the course of cinema history. Filled with memorable set pieces, noteworthy performances and much to ponder, Dune: Part 2 is an all-round success story that deserves all the praise that is being heaped upon it.5 blue drinks out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",

If writing the scenarios is considered the destruction of genuine ideas and changing content for some other totally non-inspiring one, and acting is plain posing and murmuring yourself in a chin, then underestimating the unfortunate audience really went too far, even according to the today's measures. This kind of film can only be seen as an example of how they should not be recorded. In my case, at least I know that I will no longer look from this director any future achievement.It's best to try to forget this experience as soon as possible. I don't know how to help it, re-reading the original novels is a process too long, but maybe it's the only way. It is obvious that none of the participants in this non-work found it necessary to spend time to read the mentioned.As for Christopher Walken, it's always nice to see him on the screen, but maybe it's time for him to, at least at the end of his career, starts choosing roles.

From the vast, shimmering deserts of Arrakis to the intricate designs of the Fremen culture, every frame is meticulously crafted and awe-inspiring. Building on the foundation laid in Part One, the action is bigger, bolder, and more thrilling. The sandworm battles are particularly impressive, showcasing the immense power and scale of these creatures. While the first half focuses heavily on world-building, the sequel delves deeper into character development. We see Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) grapple with his destiny, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) navigate the Fremen power dynamics, and Chani (Zendaya) emerge as a strong voice of reason. The cast delivers strong performances across the board. Chalamet continues to impress as the conflicted Paul, while Ferguson brings depth and complexity to Lady Jessica. Zendaya shines with her nuanced portrayal of Chani, and the supporting cast, including Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin, adds further weight to the narrative.The film's first half feels rushed at times, cramming in a lot of exposition to catch viewers up on plot points left unresolved in Part One. This can be jarring for those unfamiliar with the source material. While visually stunning, the film struggles to match the emotional weight of the first installment. The complex themes of power, destiny, and ecological balance are present, but not fully explored. The film ends on a cliffhanger, setting the stage for a potential third part. While this may leave some viewers satisfied, others might find it frustrating.The cinematography by Greig Fraser is magnificent, capturing the vastness of Arrakis and the intricate details of the Fremen culture. The score by Hans Zimmer is once again powerful and evocative, adding to the film's epic atmosphere. The sound design is immersive, placing viewers right in the heart of the action.\"Dune: Part Two\" is a visually stunning and action-packed continuation of the epic saga. While the pacing and emotional impact are not quite as strong as the first film, the performances, technical aspects, and deeper exploration of the characters and world make it a worthwhile experience for fans of science fiction and grand-scale storytelling.

    "Review Content": "Dune Part Two is the sequel to the very successful Dune adaptation. The story picks up right where we left off in the first film. Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) unite with the Fremen in their quest to avenge their betrayed family. Paul must prove himself as the so called messiah, the \"Lisan al Gaib\", to unite the different Fremen colonies and overthrow the emperor out of power. He alongside Chani (Zendaya), a fierce warrior and ambitious love interest, will be tested by the brutality of the desert and even more brutal Harkonnens.I'll start by saying this surpasses the first film. The depth and weight of the events that are carried out in this sequel are even more intriguing than the first. The first act mainly gives time for Paul and Chani's relationship development. It follows Paul's trials to becoming Fremen (with a particular scene in mind that I won't spoil for you but it involves a sand worm and is one if not my favorite sequence of the entire film). You are also introduced to new characters like the Emperor played by the legendary Christopher Walken and Princess Irulan played by Florence Pugh, who both are excellent in the film. This is only the first act.The Dune films are brought to life by an ensemble of actors who truly give it their all and portray their characters beautifully. Two performances that stood out for me were Javier Bardem and Austin Butler's \"Stilgar\" and \"Feyd-Rautha\". Props to Javier for including here some awesome comedic timing. His subtle nuances give out these wonderful moments for a good laugh, and it works for me so well because it is unexpected. On the other hand, Austin gives this demonic portrayal which gave me a whole new prospective on his cepabilities as an actor, terrifying but amazing.Each character is further explored and given time to shine. If the first film was more about acknowledging the lore of the Dune universe to the viewers, this film is more about our character's development and arcs.The score of this film somehow got even better than the first one. So much emotion and love was given here. Furthermore, I recently found out the cinematographer who worked on both Dune films is the same one who worked on films which I love like \"The Batman\" and \"The Creator\". Greig Fraser's capture of shots in Dune Part Two will blow your mind. Oscar worthy. The shots that stand out for me are the wide shots. They are glorious. With the mixture of a superb soundtrack by the brilliant Hans Zimmer, the angelic beauty of Greig Fraser's shots and of course the direction of Denis Villeneuve, you are left with a masterpiece.This film is truly a triumph of cinema. In all honesty, I would love for them to make a third film and conclude this into a trilogy but I am also good with them leaving it the way it is. I am fulfilled by the ending and entertained to my core. What an experience, wow.",

It was long but thick with character development. The fight scenes were there for the plot only and didn't make me fall asleep to 30 mins of cgi superhero action. Instead it furthers the plot. It wasn't action packed but layers of lore and story building.But the rage from the reviews of slow action, boring characters, \"lame\" sci-fi makes me laugh and worry. This is epic storytelling, not force fed action. You will have to have an attention span that can focus more than a few minutes at a time. If you can break the cycle of needing non stop stimulation and instead melt into a rich deep story with world building and character arch, you don't be disappointed. Obviously not for everyone but what is. But one of the best film (franchises) I've seen in years. Truly hoping to see the full arch of Paul's story with a 3rd.",

That it is style over substance. And it almost always turns out to be the case. 'Dune: Part 2' was no exception. If people want to sit there, under the influence of whatever they may choose, and just enjoy a visually spectacular film, good for them. Not me though. I like a film that is willing to go to some unexpected places. That is going to leave you thinking long after you leave the theatre. This film was neither of those things.There's an incredible cast assembled for this movie, however none of them really stand out above the rest. For an almost three hour long movie it feels like most of them get a surprisingly small amount of screen time. Austin Butler was probably the pick of the bunch with a menacing villain performance. On the other hand I really struggle to buy Timothée Chalamet as a bad-ass hero. And could we get subtitles for Javier Bardem? I don't think I understood a single word he said in the film.I will say this one is probably better than 'Dune' (2021) for the simple reason that there actually a couple of decent sequences in the movie here and there. Throughout the 170 minute run time there were a couple of 10 minute sequences where I wasn't completely bored out of my mind. Otherwise though, this was a long and arduous journey to sit through. I must've checked my watch 30 times. A generous 4/10.",

    "Review Content": "Since the first part of Dune (2021), Paul (Timothee Chalamet) and mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson-about as tough a lady as ever depicted besides Lady Macbeth) join the native tribe of Fremen\non sandy planet Arrakis after being clobbered by the family of Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard). We know more than ambition is involved, viz., spice, a mind-opening drug and fuel (damn good stuff, I'd guess).The Freman leader, Stilgar (Javier Bardem-always room for more of his talent), believes Paul is their Messiah to defeat the Harkonnen and their eventual new leader, Feyed (Austin Butler, sans hair and guitar but with a very bald head and bloody cudgel). Paul readily assimilates with Fremen and totally assimilates with Freman Chani (Zendaya),Paul may be an outsider, but then so was Christ, except that Paul (and Biblical Paul) is reluctant and Christ not so much. With romance developing between Paul and Chani, the allusion to Christ steps aside except for those who think there's more to the Jesus and Mary Magdalene friendship. Anyway, it's classic salvation by an outsider ( consider, if you will, the US and Vietnam).The special effects are what makes this epic film about as beautiful as any you will ever see, which includes riding monstrous worms and a tank bigger and more nimble than any you have ever seen. While the landscape has an inherent greyness much of the time, director Dennis Villeneuve invites comparison to David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia from the blistering landscapes to the blue eyes. Even the worm's magic elixir is arrestingly blue.The conflicting interests go beyond Arrakis as Emperor Shaddam IV (underused Christopher Walken) and his hip daughter, Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh), involve themselves in the dynamic and dangerous political scene. As for the Spice, the Harkonnen clan have already begun renewing production while Fremen want the opposite- a hot mess.The visual splendor and intricate politics return in yet a third epical rendering, Dune: Messiah. I, for one, can easily last another three hours.",

Austin butler and florence pugh were good additions to the story .. and zendaya .. what a performance from her ... Stallen skarsgard was really unique characher ... And lastly josh brolin what a comeback in the story ... I can't wait to see the last chapter of the journey hoping it will be as perfect as dune 2 and wishing it to be better too .",

    "Review Content": "Perfect in almost every detail.Visually breathtaking; narratively airtight every step of the way; new characters (for the movie, not the source) introduced so seamlessly that you could almost believe they were in Part 1; a scale that fully captures the epic sweep of the story; a score and sound design so enveloping that you could almost believe you were there. Plus Chalamet and Zendaya. What performances, with Zendaya especially bringing to vivid life the character that has dwelt in my mind's eye for nearly 50 years.And *that* change to a critical character arc, that was so perfectly executed that it takes only a few moments to realise that the problem was in the source's handling of that thread - and that this was part of Herbert's own critique of his work.Absolutely masterly film making by a director at the peak of his powers.Roll on Messiah.",

    "Review Content": "(spoilers) Have been waiting awhile (over 2 years actually like everyone else) for director Villeneuve's continuation with Dune 2 and was not disappointed. 'Dune 2' is a formidable and at times spectacular cinema. I will say I liked its predecessor's pacing better than this one whose finale seemed a bit anti-climactic and off kilter. The stylized visuals give way to a cramped and dark-lit final set that seemed like a stage play oddly a bit out of place from some earlier beautiful, and intricate set designs.. Catching this on IMAX though was certainly worthwhile though. Javier Bardem fills in for the life and energy of the movie somewhat similar to Jason Momoa in the earlier film. Easily the best scene of the movie for me was the earlier fight scene with Harkonnen harvester, ground troops and Paul and Chani in serious battle , the fight choreography and melding of visual affects and sound was absoluately stunning and 1st rate putting even the Empire Strikes Back Hoth effects to shame. Was overall pleased with this entry and looking forward to Villeneuve's next picture, hopefully Science Fiction. Got the feelling more Dune will be on the way - looking forward to it. Give it a 7/10.",

    "Review Content": "**Possible Spoilers**Dune: Part Two takes right off from where the first Dune film left us hanging. And it's just as dreamy yet more ambitious than its predecessor.Dune: Part Two almost feels like a critique of 'The Chosen One' motif of other movies, and shows the 'pros and cons' of being chosen as a supposed saviour in the eyes of desperate people in a desperate world. What happens for those who are not the 'One'? The world around them gets mighty tricky to navigate, and coming to terms with what is to come... is a lot easier said than done.Dune: Part Two is equal parts spectacular and unusually somber with its high-concept sci-fi trappings. I'm just glad the two movies can finally complement each other; there's bound to be fan-edits that make it a five-hour-plus feature (or it could become reality via a Director's Cut or something), and fans are gonna dissect every scene on YouTube videos speculating as to what the future holds for the Dune franchise on-screen. And it's a breed of film which deserves that kind of online speculation because it's rich with world-building and foreshadowing that may surprise us when they make Dune: Messiah as a movie.Sure it's cliche for reviewers to note the Star Wars similarities, but I gotta say that Dune finally becoming a cinematic franchise to compete with it is nothing short of a miracle (even if the book basically willed George Lucas' magnum opus into existence in the first place) that would Frank Herbert proud.Dune: Part Two is a LOT of movie to digest, but it's no slouch. This is what high-concept filmmaking should strive to be; this is how to channel all that money into something that's worth the effort, and it doesn't have contempt for its audience either. Dune: Part Two can send messages to the rest of Hollywood on how to tackle legacy properties well.2024's first sci-fi blockbuster does justice to one of the most important novels ever written, and it raises the bar pressuring Hollywood to get its collective asses into high-gear instead of slouching on so-so productions (looking at you, Madame Web).Dune: Part Two is good stuff. Give it a shot before the spice runs dry at the movies. 5/5 stars.",

    "Review Date": "2024-03-03",
    "Review Content": "My Review-\nDune: Part Two\nIn Cinemas now\nMy Rating 10/10I checked my 10/10 ratings for Science fiction or futuristic movies or television series and out of 700 reviews Dune Part Two is only the 5th movie in this genre that I really can't fault.I could see where every cent of the estimated USD 190,000,000 that this second instalment of Denis Villeneuve's adaptation of author Frank Herbert's six Dune novels has been spent .Dune Part One had an estimated budget of\nUSD 165,000,000 and World Wide box office gross so far is nearly USD 434,000,000 so hopefully this instalment will be as successful, it certainly deserves to be.Judging from his first two movies in this franchise I expect at least two more Denis Villeneuve movie instalments.I scored Dune 1 a healthy 8 out of 10 in my previous review but I then was a novice Duner however the state of the art technology of Dune 2 as well as the performances impressed me so much .I cannot think of any other movie of the epic futuristic genre that outdoes Dune for spectacle or innovation\nFor instance the inspired monochrome filming of the Feyd- Rautha gladiator battle in the stadium in front of Baron Harkonnen I thought was extraordinary.Of course CGI computer generated imagery is constantly used in all sci fi epics but in Dune Part 2 it seems to blend into reality in Villeneuve's desert world with such beauty and dramatic impact.This movie is a triumph of design by visual-effects supervisor Paul Lambert and the behind the scenes artisans who invented such creations like the dragonfly-inspired ornithopter to the ominous Harkonnen spice harvesters also called crawlers .Then there's the terrifying giant sand worms that live on the desert planet Arrakis whose larvae produce the special spice known as melange.I haven't spent much time on the plot line as readers of the books and viewers of the movie will know that Dune Part 1 left Paul Atreides trying to join the Fremen in an attempt to overthrow The Emperor and bring peace to Arrakis . Paul after surviving the attack from the Harkonnen and Sardaukar is literally left between a rock and a hard place .Dune Part 2 begins with Paul Atreides united with Chani a Fremen woman he falls in love with . He is taught the ways of the Fremen and is eventually accepted by them after passing a deadly initiation .Paul is seeking revenge against the sadistic Harkonnen who murdered his family and after becoming a Leader and prophet among the Fremen is in a powerful position\nto attempt to overthrow the colonising, sadistic Harkonnens . They include the sadistic nephew of the fascist Baron Vladimir Harkonnen a reptilian like villain called Feyd Rautha . Feyd and his uncle both see control of Arrakis as a path to the throne.One of the reasons I give Dune Part 2 a top score is because the entire leading cast as well as the supporting ensemble cast give superb performances.Repeating his role of Paul Atreides is Timothée Chalamet who really is impressive in Dune Part 2 expanding on his character from the first movie I think he as well as thd movie itself may well be a contenders for a Best Picture and Best actor Oscar in 2025.Timothée Chalamet already highly regarded for his acting versatility surprised me again in this movie especially when his character changes dramatically to a leader and prophet after surviving death by poisoning during the dreaded water of life ritual .My prediction is that the Dune movie franchise will do for Timothée Chalamet what the Indiana Jones movie franchise did to propel Harrison Ford to super stardom.Zendaya is also perfectly cast as Paul's romantic interest Chani a female Fremen warrior Chani . Chani is outstanding and the chemistry between this couple is magnetic .The most pleasant surprise for me in this outstanding movie was Austin Butler's performance as a cruel sadistic gladiator and cousin of Baron Harkonnen.I try thought he was great as Elvis but since then in interviews and other roles I doubted he could portray such a cruel and evil character . Of course make up helps a lot but top marks to Austin Butler perhaps a supporting actor nomination next year? There are many impressive performances in Dune 2 including Javier Bardem as Stilgar , Josh Brolin as Gurney Halleck , Charlotte Rampling as Mother Superior and Stellan Skarsgård as Baron Harkonnen.I'm looking forward to seeing more of Florence Pugh as Princess Irulan now betrothed to Paul Atreidis her role will be pivotal in Dune Part 3 which hasn't begun production yet.I've mentioned the cast of Dune Part 2 , the look of Dune Part 2 but for me the sound and the film score of a great film is an important factor to add to the enjoyment of a movie and 2 time Oscar winning composer Hans Zimmer creator of great epic scores like Gladiator and Dunkirk scores returns to continue his musical magic in Dune Part 2.I saw this with movie with 2 friends who love cinema as much as I do on a huge cinema screen as this film should be seen and we unanimously agreed as we sat there watching the closing credits and listening to the wonderful film score that this is a superb film in every way and what the magic of movies is all about .I would be amazed if Dune Part 2 is the end to this franchise it's a wonderful cinema experience I can't recommend it highly enough but don't see it till you have seen Dune Part One.",

The movie was so magical that I completely lost track of time, and thus feared that the movie would suddenly end, because I could not get enough of it.

With that said, the first movie captured the essence of Dune as well as you could and kept true to the plot for the most part.This second movie, however, kills some characters and dynamics. Why is Stilgar only a comedic relief? Why did they decide to leave Alia, one of the most important characters in the books, out of the movie? Why is the relationship between Chani and Paul so shallow? They even left out that they had a son that died. The ending scene is underwhelming and is not in line with Paul from the books.If you're willing to ignore these issues, or you have never read the books at all, this is still a GREAT movie, but the authentic Dune experience still remains Frank Herbert's book.",

It combines blockbuster level polish and action with some of the most thought-provoking, timely themes in a sci-fi movie in the past decade.The writing is thoughtful and engaging. The acting from everyone is absolutely superb (standouts from Javier Bardem and Timothee Chalamet). The music is stunning, and the sound design even more so. Giant sand monsters have never felt more menacing, and explosive action scenes never more raw. The CGI is exquisite. Never once do any of the alien worlds presented feel artificial. The best part, though, has to be the cinematography. Almost every single shot could be a wallpaper, poster, or painting.In an age where big-budget movies are floundering, and tired franchises are puttering out, Dune is bringing crowd-pleasing, epic movies back. I can't wait for the next chapter.Long live the fighters!",

    "Review Title": "One of the Best Films I Have Seen in Years",
    "Review Date": "2024-03-03",
    "Review Content": "I will be pondering this film for many days after this review, but I will give it my best shot for now. For context, I am someone who has never read the source material, never seen the David Lynch adaptation, and never seen the mini-series from the year 2000. I went into Dune: Part One a couple of years ago and the story was completely fresh for me so I loved it, but it also felt slightly unfulfilling. Well, I take that last comment back now, because once I dove into the real meat of the story with Dune: Part Two, this duo of films became one of my favourite sci-fi stories ever. Here is why I found Dune: Part Two to be a genuine masterpiece.Picking up right where the first film leaves off (with a bit of time passing in between), Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) is now living with the Fremen and learning their ways. His mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) being pregnant definitely raises some issues amongst the people, but they believe Paul is their saviour, so they choose to follow him. After having visions throughout the first film of a woman named Chani (Zendaya), they form a bond in this film that seems unbreakable. The Harkonnen family is also not about to slow down and Paul will lead anyone and everyone he has to, to stop this family from succeeding. With the introduction of the Emporer (Christopher Walken) as the man who was truly behind past destruction, this addition made for a far deeper story for me. He doesn't have a lot of screen time, but his presence opened a lot of doors for further storytelling. When it all comes down to it, this is a spiritual, thought-provoking, exciting, and subdued epic sci-fi film that has layers upon layers of storytelling, that's almost too much to get into here.I will say that where the story takes the character of Paul by the end of the film is not what I expected in the least. Once the first act of this film wrapped up, I found myself completely unaware of where the story was going. Again, since I had no prior knowledge of this story, this was unpredictable for me in all the best ways. A couple of surprises and twists absolutely blew me away and had me thinking it's some of the best Blockbuster storytelling I've seen in years. Timothée Chalamet also gives one of the best performances of his career to date here, which just elevated this already incredible story. My only complaint with this film though, is actually also a massive compliment.There are a couple of characters that are introduced in this film that feel so vital to the story coming to an end, that I found myself perplexed why we didn't see them in the first film. With that said, Dune: Part Two doesn't waste a second of its run time in that regard. Characters are introduced, made incredibly important, and performed insanely well, and they help bring the overall story to a close. I may be disappointed that they aren't introduced in the first, director Denis Villeneuve just simply knew what he was doing and my complaint ended up becoming praise.Villeneuve is one of the best directors out there today, without question, and the work he was able to get out of his cast and crew was breathtaking. From jaw-dropping Cinematography by Greig Fraser, to stunning visual effects by hundreds of VFX workers, to the pulse-pounding and goosebump-inducing score, down to the perfect editing and masterful costumes and sets, there's nothing I can complain about. On a technical level, Dune: Part Two is perfection and with a more than satisfying story to go along with that, I just can't remember the last time I watched a movie this good on the big screen, especially on this scale.I could gush about Dune: Part Two for many hours, so I'll just wrap this up by commending this entire cast and crew for creating such a piece of art. This is a remarkable achievement in cinema and it better be recognized at next year's Oscars. I know that releasing a film this early in the year is questionable, but I believe the love this film is getting will propel it forward. My jaw is still on the floor from experiencing this film yesterday and I can't wait to watch it again and let it all sink in. It's not the type of sci-fi film that will be for everyone, but if you've seen the first instalment and at least liked it, I can't see how this would let you down in any way. Dune: Part Two is now playing in theatres and I highly recommend checking out this masterpiece on the biggest screen you can find.",

    "Review Date": "2024-03-02",
    "Review Content": "Dune 2 ReviewThe following was my first reaction after watching this film...It was good, but it was long. I mean it was good, it was good. But it was long. Now I'm not saying I didn't like it, it was good ok? But it was long. Did it need to be that long? Well ok it was a really big story so yeah OK it probably needed to be that long. But it was long, man. But it was good. But it was long. I don't know what my final decision is because you know, it was good. But it was long...I caught someone sitting in front of me checking the time as the film slowly slogged on. Performances were solid all around. The story is well worn. The photography was, well, iconic. But it seemed a little too much on the extreme close ups of faces. My god, the lensing was so tight that in one shot the character's eyes were in focus but his nose was out of focus. On Imax, we can inspect every pore on his skin.Overall, there was something more exciting about part one, as we are introduced to the setup. Am intriguing world shot in a iconic way. Engaging characters in energetic scenes. I saw the first part twice in the theatre. I have the DVD at home and have watched it again since. I am not so excited about revisiting part two. I guess it's a kind of phenomena like the Matrix. The first film was very appealing because of it's well crafted fantasy world that was exciting to learn about. But by the second movie, it was already kind of been there, done that. I sort of had the same reaction with The Dark Knight Rises after enjoying the bombastic Dark Knight.Dune as a story is so popular, George Lucas used it as one of his sources for Star Wars. The chosen one template is very familiar, and it takes larger-than-life filmmaking to make it something that stands out. This comes in the form of the depiction of a desert world that has gargantuan flying machines. The domiciles in this world are simple but elegant. The costumes are evocative of ancient religions. The music fit as well as it did in part one.Appropriately, the second movie is simply titled Part Two. For it is more of the same. So the second outing there is less awe to some degree, and more drama, with shots of very very large heads. I'm not knocking this film in any way. I think perhaps my own short attention span is at fault. As an editor, I wouldn't dare question the wisdom of the people who put this together. It is a service to all fans of this classic story to tell it right. Perhaps if I was the director, I would pick up the pacing of the dialogue just a wee little bit. But I'm sure it wouldn't work as well.In conclusion, the movie has many good scenes of grandeur, but has more scenes of big faces. Sure, great care was taken to hire some of the most attractive faces available, so that helps. I guess I enjoy rollicking adventures more than slightly sedate adventures like this one. Maybe time will change my attitude about Part Two compared to Part One. But for now I will give it a 7 out of 10.",

The scale of this feels so massive and makes you feel so tiny in so many scenes and it blew me away. The effects were so damn brilliant with some of the most stunning visuals you will ever be able to see from a movie. The acting by the entire cast was completely from the top shelf with a special shout-out to Austin Butler, his Feyd-Rautha was perfect and the score oooft, it had me tapping my foot at times. I also swear at some points I could smell the sand that's how immersed I was in this movie.After watching a couple more lower budget type Sci-fi movies lately that are slightly different Sci-fi genre like Synchronic and Freaks (which I enjoyed both a lot) to then go and watch Dune part 2 and just think yeahhhhh this is a whole other level. I think I saw the budget for the new Gladiator was 310 million and Dune part 2 was 190 million. For this to look just as unbelievably amazing as it did with that budget it makes me think what the hell will they do with Gladiator money?I've read the book and loved it, I've seen part 1 and 2 and loved them. Some scenes in part 2 in the movie were so much better than imagined from the book. Any Sci-fi lover that doesn't like this movie I'll be shocked. It's an absolute epic of the genre that I think will be hard to top anytime soon if at all. Everyone needs to see this on the big screen and lose yourself on the planet Dune.Denis Villeneuve has nailed this and might be my favourite creator in the industry at the moment with Nolan. Their tone and styles just extract the unreal I crave from cinema at the moment, hopefully a lot more to come.",

I won't list anything here due to spoilers. I'll maybe blog about it in a few weeks. Maybe not. It certainly looks great, and I rated it 6/10 for that. Not for characters and story.

There's a lot more stuff that happens in part 2, but the core of the Dune story is lost.I liked the film. The film looks great. The CGI is great. It's paced well, and it's an enjoyable ride. The actors all do a good job. Big scenes, neat visuals and so on. It has an \"epic\" feel, but it's only skin-deep.There's barely any depth to the story you're seeing. Things/events obviously happen, but it's like it's a summary of a story rather than the story itself. There's zero tension or danger in the story - there are no stakes, no danger, no victory. The characters just do things but never seem to actually experience anything. There is no hardship, no loss, no vistory.There are no thrills, because there is no danger. There are no stakes because Paul (and the Fremen) never lose. There is no victory because the audience never feels like the good guys might lose. There is absolutely nothing thought-provoking in the slightest. There are no philosophical ideas (unlike the source novel).One review claims the film is \"thought-provoking\". Anyone who finds this film thought-provoking is literally braindead, and has never experienced actual thoughts. The same review claimed it was \"THRILLING\", using a scene where Dave Bautista escapes via a helicopter. I can tell you honestly that there were no thrills in that scene.Paul joins the Fremen, and then instantly becomes a military leader. Even his trial of living in the desert is skipped. He never experiences any trials or danger. Events just happen with no build-up. There is no emotional connection to anything happening.Unfortunately, it's ultimately all spectacle with no heart. The story is epic, the vistas epic, the everything is epic, except the story.",

This film is meant to be seen in the theater on the biggest screen possible. For those who thought Part One was more on the slow side with more character development, will be very pleased to hear that Part Two ups the ante with the action spectacle. There was so many iconic scenes and visuals that it's hard to say which one was my favorite. Our newcombers for Part Two with Austin Butler, Florence Pugh, and Christopher Walken are all awesome. Austin's character especially is very good and he transforms into the role. Some may not even realize that it's him in the role, as his features and voice are both unrecognizable here. I can't wait to watch the in depth behind the scenes to see how this movie was made. Music Composer Hans Zimmer does an absolute terrific job once again on the score as it is epic on so many levels. Part 2 does such a great job of story telling that even if someone missed Part One they would still understand what is transpiring. I'm already looking forward on what Part Three will have in store for us. Dune: Part Two gets the highest rating score possible with a perfect 10 out of 10. Go see it!",

    "Review Content": "Let me be perfectly clear about this: Dune: Part Two is a wonderful film. As epic stories based on a book but condensed for cinema go, it doesn't get much better. Though I've never read any of the books, it's clear many of it's complexities got lost in the transition. It's also clear that this is not a great fit for cinema, if adapted it should be a series.As big budget blockbusters go it's even more impressive as it's both grandiose but still offers some substance.The reason for my low score lies in the fact that this is the middle part of something that might never be finished.The first film was called \"Dune: Part One\". I knew what I was getting into. The \"part one\" portion of the title was clear. So I looked it up and when I read that the first book would be divided into two films and the second of those was going to be released in a month or so I decided to watch it. I was still slightly disappointed at just how abruptly the film ended but I was prepared.The closer I got to the ending of Part Two the more it became apparent something similar was going to happen. And there it was, suddenly the movie ended. I rechecked and indeed I had read it right. Not only was this supposed to be the end of a two-parter but a third movie wasn't announced yet. It's not sure to happen and even if it does, it will be years in the making.I don't know who to blame for this: Director Denis Villeneuve, Warner Bros., Legendary or someone/thing else but one thing is for sure, this whole franchise and whatever future it has will never see a single cent of my money ever again.",

By now I am so tired of the CGI specticals of Disney that are pushed in their Marvel and Star Wars films because they lack a good story.

It's brings this space epic into a whole new bigger scale than the first, I'm no Lisan Al-Gaib, but I see another Academy Award in his future.Greig Frasers visuals are fantastic, this movie is gorgeous some of the images deserve their own portrait, it just does the most to tell a story without anyone saying anything.Visual Effects in a much bigger scale and they nailed it, I already loved them in the first, but I don't know how they actually outdid themselves with this one.Dennis Villenueve has written himself in history books with this space epic, this is what it should feel going into the theatre for a blockbuster. Love the choices he made, there's this parallel I noticed and adored, in the beggining of the movie when Paul and his mother arrive in Fremen city they are surrounded by Fremen who hate thee since he killed one of their own, but as he accepts he is Lisan Al-Gaib he's walking through the Fremen who love him and worship him. It was beautiful.The hype is real, go watch this movie, support it, we want more of this, we NEED more of this.",

    "Review Content": "Dune: Part Two has been universally hailed as a sequel worthy of Terminator: Judgment Day, The Godfather Part II, and The Empire Strikes Back; a bonafide epic yielding additional comparisons to Ben-Hur and Lawrence of Arabia; a picture that solidifies Denis Villeneuve as one of the modern titans of the art form. Even those who weren't so hot on the first film, finding its characters monotonous and its visuals largely dull, seem to have been thoroughly won over.And although I enjoyed the visuals and thought there was a purpose to their occasional drabness (imposing brutalist structures towering over nature), the new film indeed cranks the art direction up to eleven, exemplifying some of the most potent visuals in sci-fi history. Although I thought the characters worked fine in the original, in the sequel we're treated to powerhouse newcomers and darker depths to the figures we know -- when critics said \"I liked Dune: Part One just fine, but I just can't buy Timothée Chalamet as the hero\", readers of the Frank Herbert novel snickered (in Part Two, new fans will see why).If nothing else, they find that the whole thing feels more complete (recall that the first movie bamboozled many who hadn't a clue it was just \"Part One\"). Frank Herbert's son, Brian, wrote \"When the new movie is combined with Dune: Part One it is by far the best film interpretation of Dune that has ever been done\".Other things that are expanded on and/or elevated include the performances of Zendaya (one of the most expressive and loveable actors of her generation, underused in the prior movie) as Chani, the young Fremen warrior who welcomed Paul Atreides into their camps after the fall of his \"House\", and Rebecca Ferguson as Lady Jessica, Paul's mother who becomes the \"Reverend Mother\" of the Fremen, who believe she and Paul are instrumental to a prophecy of a mother and child sent to reclaim Planet Arrakis from oppression -- the Imperial spice-mining colonies that now belong to the vile Harkonnen family. On that note, we also get a better look at the Harkonnen homeworld, whose \"black sun\" seems to erase all color from it, bar the blackest of black and whitest of white.This moment is one of many reasons you need to see this in a theater. I cannot stress it enough. These sequences -- from the most thunderous battles and Sandworm rides to the intimate final duel that left my audience at the edge of their seats -- are paralyzing to behold in an auditorium, complete with music and sound design that seem to make the very Earth tremble (then falling dead silent at pivotal moments), all sublimely photographed by \"swirly bokeh\" extraordinaire Greig Fraser. (It's not often you see a film and just know you're witnessing the creation of \"iconic\" images.) The action scenes are elevated by impressive choreography and, of course, the performances.The most intense of the new faces is undoubtedly Austin Butler as Feyd Rautha (that's the Sting character in the 1984 movie, in case you needed the reference), lauded by many as the best villain performance since Anton Chigurh and Ledger's Joker. Additional newcomers include Florence Pugh as Princess Irulan, Léa Seydoux as Lady Fenring of the \"Bene Gesseret\" priestesses, and Christopher Walken as Emperor Shaddam IV.Returning actors include Javier Bardem as the Fremen leader Stilgar, whose incorrigible fanaticism gets some big laughs; Josh Brolin as Gurney Halleck, who is out for Harkonnen blood; Stellan Skarsgård as the revolting Baron Harkonnen; Dave Bautista as The Beast Rabban, who envies the affection the Baron shows toward Feyd; and Charlotte Rampling as the Imperial Reverend Mother, who hatches schemes of her own. Certain characters I've mentioned are given just a few minutes of screen time, yet they all make a considerable impact, from the memorable line reads to the looks that speak even louder, most notably during that final exchange of haunting glances between Paul, Chani, and the Princess.At the center is Chalamet as Paul \"Muad'Dib\" Atreides -- a performance that will vindicate his stans and make non-believers hopefully realize not only how formidable he can be, but what he was truly going for in Part One. Chalamet is known for his thin frame and his friendly demeanor; yet, we have absolutely no trouble believing that his Paul would be a master of sparring and a conqueror of Sandworms. As I wrote earlier, those who judged the first movie by how well his story works as a garden-variety \"Hero's Journey\" are bound to have an \"oh\" moment or two.If you're still worried that some of these elements seem lifted from other works, recall that Dune is (likely) an older series than whatever you're thinking of. All the same, even the familiar images feel new here -- epic in scale in a way that cinema hasn't been able to achieve until now. This movie is a close-to-perfect marriage of hitherto unthinkable technology and a crystal-clear vision for said tech to realize. In part, the movie plays as if Villeneuve heard the complaints of the previous film and, as if on a dare, went all the way with his movie magic for the sequel, putting the doubters in their place.Knowing how the books go, I know this franchise is far from done. And despite how long this film was, I never wanted it to end and still crave more, ergo I'm more than stoked to see what Villeneuve does with the rest of Herbert's legendarium and if audiences keep finding resonance in his version of it. The world of Dune is a uniquely well-realized potential future: intimidatingly immense and outlandish on one hand, and dreadfully convincing on the other, showing that Imperialism and colonialism may be alive and well millennia ahead. (Had this film been made with even less studio interference, the parallels between the Fremens' plight and Palestine may have been even more obvious.)The story of Dune Messiah still needs to be adapted and I'm confident that, once Villeneuve shows it to us, the same media illiterates who started posting Film Twitter Takes about how Poor Things approves of misogyny once that film came out on digital won't be taking Paul's \"White Savior\" and Jessica's cultural appropriation at face value -- or so we may hope. An interesting theory from Walter Chaw suggests that the reason so many people keep failing to get the point of Dune -- and Paul Atreides specifically -- is that \"colonialism is so embedded in our value system as manifest destiny\" that it's straight-up impossible for some of us to interpret a figure like this as anything other than a good guy. Lisan al-Gaib, and all that.",

    "Review Content": "So I finally got the chance to watch Dune: Part Two in theaters, and Oh my god, I think some how this movie made history of best sci-fi flick of all time, and it's so cinematic and completely big when you see this movie in IMAX! This movie has made the greatest cinematic achievement that no sci-fi movies has ever gone before, with every best scale that's so huge you will see it to believe it!I mean, it's basically the same, like the first movie, but there's some moments that give me \"Avatar\" vibes. But still tho. Timothée Chalamet, did really great job, and Austin Butler nailed his performance, and Zendaya was brilliant! Every single actors for this movie nailed there performances, the acting was quite amazing and the dialogue and the story was EPIC and so DARING and a MASTERPIECE!Timothée and Austin both killed it in the film, and the 3rd act was fantastic, not gonna say anything tho, but Timothée steals the whole show! Not a bad movie, but definitely better than the first one. And the original for sure! Denis Villeneuve, had made the greatest sci-fi thrilling movie of 2024, and Hans Zimmer did a beautiful job with his composed score 100%!10/10.",

Denis Villeneuve is a very skillful director with a detailed eye for filmmaking and I cannot help but like every movie of his that I see. The villains (especially the new younger one) were intimidating and the internal disagreements and conflict that the Freman had among themselves made the film less simplistic and more like it would likely be in real life among any group looking for/waiting for a prophet. Quality action, visuals, story, and characters/character development makes for a quality film!",

As our attention spans get shorter and shorter, it's damn near impossible to keep someone entertained for that long. Not only did I stay in my seat, but I don't feel like I blinked out of fear that I would miss something. The pace is perfect. It's beautifully shot and edited. The score is amazing. I thoroughly believe that even non Sci Fi fans would enjoy this film. It's a masterpiece. I also wanted to clarify something for others if they wondering. This movie is the very definition of a \"part two\" instead of a sequel. It finishes the story from part one and completes the first book of the dune series. Hopefully you see it as soon as possible. I also hope we all get to enjoy a 3rd movie in this series.",

I love Christopher Walken but it was hard to not internally laugh at his iconic voice during the film.Hans Zimmer of course delivers again, though it felt a little more subdued than part one.Dune Part one and Part two is no doubt the science fiction grand epic of the 2020's.",

Also the acting, the scenery, the music. A masterpiece. I also loved that there weren't prolonged sequences of fights or anything, in a way it's a movie of vignettes that are well executed, well conected and make logical and easy to follow story.

Finally, when I realised it's already the second part of the film and we are nearing the end, all I was able to think was, it's going to be a looooong wait for part 3.

I really think this movie is amazing in every aspect.Starting with the world building, this was my favorite aspect from the first movie, and this movie builds further on that in such excellence, and in combination with the astounding cinematography I really felt like I was there on arrakis. You will learn much more about the freman and their ways of life which is fascinating. I'm still in shock and I want to go back.All the performance are also so good. The story builds further on all the old characters who are fleshed out even more with new complex layers to them and the new characters who are also all great, especially Austin Butler! His performance makes his character truely scary, such a good villain. Timothee Chalamet is also great is this movie and really shows the complex things Paul is going thru this movie, which was really cool and even scary sometimes to see unfold. The same goes for all the other actors, I just can't say there was a lesser performance, everyone really gave there all and it shows!Also, the score is (again) incredibly good! Hans Zimmer also builds upon the music he made for the first movie, which results in an even better score which also elevates the movie to an even higher level.In conclusion, this movie is a masterpiece, it starts slower, but that's a good thing. It needs that, so in that way everything keeps building upon each other which eventually explodes in one of the best climaxes I have ever seen! I'm really still in awe, and I could keep talking about how great everything is, but believe me, just watch the movie. Go to the biggest screen you can find and watch it. You will be blown away, this is really one of the best films of the generation.

    "Review Date": "2024-03-03",
    "Review Content": "Back in 2021, at the height of the coronavirus pandemic, HBO Max (now known as simply Max) released Denis Villeneuve's adaption of \"Dune\" the same day that it was released theatrically. So, I decided to sit down on my couch and give it a watch. Perhaps influenced by the horrendous streaming experience - with constant freezes, bufferings, and drops in quality - I didn't much enjoy \"Dune.\" Cut to March 1, 2024. I planned on seeing \"Dune: Part Two\" in theatres. Before doing so, in order to refresh my (alcohol-influenced and shockingly poor) recollection, I decided to watch 2021's \"Dune\" again, this time on 4k Blu-Ray. And even though the viewing experience was far better than the one I had watching it many years ago on HBO Max, to my surprise, my opinion remained the same - \"Dune,\" to me, was a visually stunning but emotionally hollow and surprisingly cold feeling film. Its lack of characterization and flimsy script didn't allow me to invest in the characters as much as I found myself investing in the world building. However, with \"Dune: Part Two\" on the horizon, I suspended my judgement until I was able to see the complete story that Villeneuve wanted to tell. Now, after watching this second installment, unfortunately, my opinion hasn't wavered.Denis Villeneuve always crafts a stunning looking and sounding film, and \"Dune: Part Two\" is no different. Its use of CGI is second to none, with effects so good looking that you'll find yourself forgetting they aren't real. The sense of scale is immense, with vistas, settings, and scenery that will make your breath catch in your throat at the sight of them. Also, a specific black and white sequence is especially striking, and almost had me wishing for a second edit of the film that completely loses all colour. To be sure, \"Dune: Part Two\" is a visual and auditory fest; and if you're going for that, and only that, you'll have a lot to love here. Where the film falters, however, is in its lack of characterization.For as gorgeous of a movie as this is, I wish that the script writing and character development was as strong as the visuals. Similar to the issue I had with the first film, \"Part Two\" continues with characters that are, frankly, flat and dry; this seems to be a trend in Villeneuve's films, so I imagine that these performances were requested by the director. And, in some way, I do understand where he may have been coming from - the world of \"Dune\" is alien, and might call for appropriately alien performances. So, I get it, but I don't like it. The actors do seem to be making the most out of what the script gives them, with Rebecca Ferguson and Javier Bardem giving standout performances - Javier especially looks like he's having a lot of fun. Timothée Chalamet, an actor that I admire, remains serviceable as Paul Atreides, but undergoes significant tonal shifts in his performance that I found not as believable as I think the filmmakers wanted these shifts to come across.The characters of the film do deal with some themes I found extremely interesting, themes of religious prophecies, faith, doubt, control and the measures people will take to attain it, and more. In that regard, I enjoyed watching how the characters that inhabit this movie all have differing opinions on the above - some think Paul truly is the one, while others regarding the prophecies as nothing more than tales meant to oppress the masses. It's really quite bold for a mainstream movie to deal with these types of topics; and while I wish Villeneuve pushed things just a bit further, I recognize that a potential third film may be going in the direction that I am hoping for.\"Dune: Part Two\" is an achievement, and begs to be seen on the biggest screen possible (or the closest seat possible, if you find yourself watching it not in Imax, but on an ordinary theatre screen, like I did). In terms of visual storytelling, the movie shines, and I imagine many high scores are being influenced by the film's razzle and dazzle. In terms of character development and strong scriptwriting, the movie faltered for me, not offering that emotional anchor necessary to invest me in the characters as much as I was invested in the world. All of that said, the world building at play truly is astounding, and I am hoping for a third installment if nothing else than to immerse myself in the universe that Villeneuve has put to film.",

    "Review Content": "Dune 2 is a masterful continuation of the epic saga set in a captivating sci-fi universe. Building upon the rich lore established in its predecessor, this film immerses viewers in a world of political intrigue, fantastical landscapes, and profound character development.Director Denis Villeneuve's visionary approach brings Frank Herbert's iconic novel to life with unparalleled brilliance. From the sweeping desert vistas to the intricate details of the various factions, every frame is a testament to meticulous craftsmanship.The performances are nothing short of stellar, with each actor fully embodying their respective roles. Timothée Chalamet's portrayal of Paul Atreides exudes both vulnerability and strength, anchoring the narrative with a compelling presence. Supporting cast members, including Zendaya, Oscar Isaac, and Rebecca Ferguson, deliver equally captivating performances, adding depth to the ensemble.The visual effects are breathtaking, seamlessly blending practical and CGI elements to create a visually stunning world that feels both authentic and otherworldly. Hans Zimmer's haunting score further elevates the cinematic experience, imbuing each scene with an emotional resonance that lingers long after the credits roll.What truly sets *Dune 2* apart, however, is its thematic depth. Beneath the spectacle lies a poignant exploration of power, destiny, and the human condition. As the story unfolds, it poses thought-provoking questions about the nature of leadership, the consequences of choice, and the interconnectedness of all life.In conclusion, Dune 2 is a triumph on every level. It surpasses its predecessor in scope, ambition, and execution, delivering a film that is as intellectually stimulating as it is visually captivating. A true masterpiece of modern cinema, deserving of the highest praise.",

One of my favourite things about the film is the belief in all the characters. There's a twist which I didn't see coming but I was pleasantly surprised and it added to the overall story. The fight scenes are awesome. The baddies are truly cruel and you definitely route for the good guys. In a nutshell to ALL Sci-fi fans go.",

    "Review Content": "This movie looks and sounds amazing. The cast are all great in their roles, the special effects are the best I've seen this year and easily stand up to the best of Villeneuve's movies. Cinematography also as goos as I've seen. The costumes and makeup also add great deal to the amazing universe they've created. I really enjoyed it over all, but I have to say that I found the pacing very unusual.The first 2 hours seemed to pass along at a normal pace for this kind of movie - lots of drama and character development with interspersed action. Around when I felt that it was starting to look like the movie was starting to wrap up and was neatly building up to a cliffhanger for the next instalment, it explodes into a colossal battle scene between all of the main characters, and the movie carried on for another 30-40 mins of action and major plot turns. You could say it's a good complaint but I just felt like they were cramming in all this really important action when they really could have chopped out so much of the first 2 hours instead and had a much better, consistent action movie throughout.Also, regarding the editing - a couple of times I wasn't sure how a scene with multiple people in it instantly jumped to a scene with just 2 people in it. For example, when Paul awakens from the coma, and after he stands up after getting slapped, he looks back at his mother and it jumps from a full room to just him and his mother. This happened in at least 2 scenes with the main character Paul, and was a little confusing - almost like they were chopping out random transitional sections to shorten the movie run time.All in all, its a fantastic sequel and an enjoyable watch, but by no means a perfect movie.",

And of course bringing drama and emotion excellent work by Hanz Zimmer on the sound track.Disney take notes this is the expectations the people have of genre like Star Wars Change your direction remake and remould what you have messed up but do not presume you will make money by buying up brands and twisting it to be an agenda you will lose again to classics like Dune.",

Regardless what makes this much better that the first is the way the time was well used to move the story along with sensible dialog .I was reminded of David Lean Lawrence of Arabia but in Space .The thumping of the sand ,the water analogies , the large sand worms have sexual connotations . It's about life , finding a way to survive . Where the individual is just a method to keep life moving forward .An epic cosmic metaphor for existence , and the fight for survival .In the end jumping back in the worm moves life all forward through time .",

    "Review Date": "2024-03-06",
    "Review Content": "First a summary of my DUNE PART 1 Review:The reason to see this is its looks. It is - I apologize for this - a feast for the eyes. We've got warring intergalactic families fighting over the rights to the universe's most important mineral: 'Spice'. We have a good son with a mysterious mother, we've got evil villains (Harkonnens), and a rebel army (Fremen) with pet worms standing guard. Even so better to lower your expectations. The giant worms ain't that much. The bald villains are too easy confused with one another. David Bautista is the one easily recognized villain, but he's surprisingly weak in his role. The film is somber; not a light moment throughout its long running time.Dune Part 2 is better. First, the plot is more compelling. The reasons for events in Part 1 are explained here. There is a love angle between the good son Paul Atreides (Timothy Chalamet) and a young Fremen woman 'Johnny' (Zendaya). In fact the very presence of Zendaya's character lifts the film mightily; she is without question someone to care about.Javier Bardem is great as the leader of The Fremen. Josh Brolin is rousing as Chalamet's protector. Austin Butler as the psychopathic next-in-line for the throne receives an A+ for creepiness (a compliment). Christopher Walken is wasted as the Emperor who is wasting away. Why he was chosen for this role beats me. Florence Pugh as his daughter is simply 'there'. Her character is a sometimes narrator; the 'sometimes' element simply confusing.Many of the characters have secrets, as well as secret motives, in this episode; though I, for one, was never quite sure about whose motives (with the exception of \"johnny's') were worth rooting for. The special effects here were disappointing; the worms were an improvement over Part 1 though seriously, I wanted to see more of them; ascertain how large they are, see them compared to other large structures. But no. I was never enthusiastic about the interstellar spacecraft; they appear more like a deck of playing cards than a speedy conveyance.Bottom line: Part 2 is a good film. However, I'd be perfectly fine if there were no Part 3.",

    "Review Content": "To be succinct, my issue with this movie is that many of the most interesting, clever, and unique story features that makes Dune so iconic were oversimplified and/or completely changed to make a very generic story that does not mirror the book in most any respect. Sitting in the theater, having only just finished my re-reading of Dune the day before, I realized that only about 20% of the movies material were scenes from the novel and even still scene were taken in a completely different context. The characters are simply not the same characters from the novel, but even more than that they are not the same as the first part and that is apparent from their inconsistent motivations. Overall, the movie is not bad. I give it 5 out of 10 because it is a generic, middle of the pack movie. Which is even more upsetting when paired with the knowledge that following the plot of the already established novel would have provided a much higher score. Quite disappointing.",

    "Review Date": "2024-03-02",
    "Review Content": "I loved the first movie. What happened with the second? For those who read the books.First, what happened to the Space Guild Navigators? One of the main plots is that the Space Guild Navigators need spice to fold space and allow travel between the systems. No where to be found in this movie. So, for those who didn't read the books. Spice comes across as a drug used like cocaine in the movie. You have no sense of urgency because if the \"Spice must flow\" is stopped. It's the end of the empire.Second, what a waste of of Christopher Walken. He comes across as the enfeebled emperor of the houses. The urgency for the emperor going to Dune is because he doesn't want Paul to tell the other houses about his betrayal? WHAT? I guess since you didn't bring in the Space Guild Navigators you had to invent another reason? Did Christopher's contract stipulate that he only wears robes or did they run out of money for his costumes? At the end of movie he looks like a homeless person walked on set. What was also missing was the pressure by the Witches and the Space Guild on the emperor to continue with spice production. Christopher was less menacing and more like 'Grandpa' needs to go to the memory care facility.Third, I knew the movie was in trouble when I looked at my watch and realized \"There's only nine minutes left in this move, how are they going to end it?\". I felt the movie was rushed to reach a conclusion and the ending battle was chaotic and short. Chaotic in not a good way. There is a whole scene about 'the atomics' that made me question on why is it in the movie? We are told about the 'atomics', but there is no follow-up to the ending battle. The fierce emperor warriors come across as incompetent wimps. The ending seemed way to rushed. It's less about a powerful emperor and more like 'how did none of the other houses not take him out?'.There are other problems that are pretty minor, like nothing is mentioned at all about the other systems. Like the Mentat's or the planet of machines. Too much time spent on 'Fade' killing people in an Arena, but failing to mention who these characters are. If you hadn't seen the first film, there deaths make no sense. Robands death seemed like an after thought. Like we need to get rid of this character, but the movie is going on too long. But, my primary complaint is the lack of 'Space Guild Navigators\" and why Spice is so important to these people. There seems to be no urgency by any of the characters to make sure \"The Spice Must Flow\". Disappointed.",

    "Review Date": "2024-03-03",
    "Review Content": "This is actually one of the few movies where I didn't necessarily agree with the high ratings. I was very excited about this sequel. Part 1 was pretty great. I'm sad I just didn't agree with what most people thought about part 2. I enjoyed the movie overall but since I didn't read the books, I was fairly confused and bored throughout the first half of the movie (besides the beginning scene) but I really did like the 2nd half though. Probably got more interesting after Austin Butler's character rolled in, honestly. Pacing. I think the pacing was weird as they could've fleshed out the relationships, training, and yeah... basically the story more. It's just not convincing compared to the first movie. I didn't feel much for the characters nor did I care for them. I didn't even care for Chani and Paul's romance. And it's like wow.. Paul is already attempting to ride the worm? It's so dangerous and he's already succeeded on his first attempt. He's THAT gifted. There were mentions of training but really no show. I mean, Paul was basically told to survive through the dessert as a test and learns how to sand walk better but that's... it. The movie simply shows the major parts but nothing much in between to build it up. It was also like watching two different movies in one and now the \"good\" side is gonna ambush and fight the \"bad\" side. I don't feel the movie did a good job of making me want to root for Paul and the fremen. I hope I'm explaining my gripes about this film well.Many big name actors/actresses. Timothee is always a good pick for these type of roles. Austin Butler's character was cool. He did a good job with the character too. I like Zendaya but she's not that great of an actress. Dave Bautista's character was poorly written. All he does is yell and get frustrated then kills one of their own to make them look like very bad enemies. So cliche. I could also barely hear/understand some of the lines which was an irk. It was especially difficult to understand Stilgar because of the accent. The cinematography was beautifully done though. Just wow. I do look forward to the sequel and am interested to see what happens next at least.",

    "Review Date": "2024-03-03",
    "Review Content": "Following the events of the first Dune film, Paul Atreides and his mother join the Fremen to destroy the Harkonnens who have control of Arrakis. Paul gets attached to Chani while learning the ways of the Fremen and his mother is pregnant with a daughter. She becomes a Reverend Mother after drinking the Water of Life. Paul starts to become a bit of messianic figure of the Fremen who look up and bow to him. With Paul's family destroyed, he has two goals: he wants revenge on the Harkonnens for what they did and he wants to prevent a bad future that he can predict.Dune Part Two was definitely among my most anticipated films of the year. The first Dune movie by Denis Villeneuve is stunning in nearly every way. Sci-fi epics like this are my favorite kinds of movies to watch and I was wondering how this story would go. The trailers looked great, but it did not prepare for the movie I experienced.Very few sequels to movies surpass the original. In my opinion, Dune: Part Two is one of them. This movie is AWESOME! It is rare for a movie's production to draw me into the movie so much that I feel a part of the film, even in theaters, but this is one of those films. The scene that Paul is riding the Sandworm from his perspective has the sand flying in our faces with the sound of the Sandworm traveling through the land sounding like a sandstorm almost. I love these kind of scenes because this is the kind of magic that I look forward to in movies. It felt like I was a part of the experience. That is just one scene of this immersive and enthralling sci-fi epic.The production in this film is nearly flawless. The cinematography by Greig Fraser is some of the most beautiful cinematography I have ever seen period. It is gorgeous and it sets up the dark tone in this movies. The scenes where Feyd is in the arena is magical representing the pure evilness of the Harkonnens. It is such a magnificent scene that stands out in a movie largely set in a desert, but it is just one scene of great cinematography. The desert shots and even a romantic scene with Paul and Chani stand out as well for the clever composition. The visual effects look real, especially the Sandworms, the sets are amazing and the costumes are some of the best I ever seen. I heard Austin Butler was in this movie but I absolutely did not recognize him. He transformed completely in this movie, partially because of the fantastic makeup.The battle scenes are epic and filled with clever tactics. I love how the Fremen can emerge from the sand to take the Harkonnen soldiers down and the scenes where Paul and Chani are fighting together. We get to see how the Fremen slowly get the upper hand on the Harkonnens with the action. The physical fights are even better here than the first movie with the choreography and intensity being on point. The action sequences are all beautifully shot and edited and some of the melee fights standout with how unique they look. The soundtrack is just as great as the first film with musical by Hans Zimmer being haunting at times. This movie has more than a few technical achievements.I love the way the story is told in this movie, it is not anything like I expected it to be. It tackles the messianic figure trope in a fantastic way and it shows why it is not always great for a certain group. Paul Atreides mixes his good intentions with his more ruthless ones and it creates a narrative that is darker than the first movie. The movie progressively gets darker as it starts out optimistic with Paul learning how to ride a Sandworm, fight like the Fremen and connecting with Chani. The last act in this movie is one of the best third acts in a movie I have seen in a long time leading to me feeling a lot of different emotions. I even felt shock through my body in one scene and that rarely ever happens when I see a movie in the theater. The story here is terrific and the direction by Denis Villeneuve is masterful. Villeneuve sets his vision for the movie perfectly and he shows that he is one of the best directors in Hollywood.The performances and characters in this movie are top-notch. The only issue I had with the first Dune is that I felt that Paul Atreides was not the most interesting protagonist. He is so much more intriguing here. He is a better fighter, wiser and a bit more ruthless. He becomes a better leader as well. Timothée Chalamet is phenomenal here. He shows so much range in emotion and fury that I saw his growth as the leader natural. His speeches are amazing and memorable with the emotions he conveys. Zendaya as Chani steals the show. Her facial expressions in the third act show so much emotion and you can tell so much about what she is thinking that it gives her character more depth than she already had. In genuine, Chani is a great character who I rooted for the whole film and Zendaya brings this character to life. I knew Zendaya is talented, but this is without a doubt her best performance I have seen from her. The other allies are awesome as well. Rebecca Ferguson is amazing as Jessica again, Javier Bardem is awesome as Stilgar and Josh Brolin brings the heart as Gurney.You cannot have a great movie without great villains and this movie has some of the most memorable villains I have seen in a while. The Baron is as evil as ever and Stellan Skarsgård is fantastic, but it is his two nephews that standout. Dave Bautista is great as Rabban as he shows a lot of rage, but also some weaknesses that kind break him. However, Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha steals the show every single time he is on screen. His screen time is a little limited since he makes his debut here, but Butler makes the most of it by transforming into this monstrous guy who loves to fight. His mannerisms, line-delivery and actions are frightening and I was nervous every time he was on screen. Feyd also has a surprising sense of honor in that he is ruthless, but he also respects people who put up a good fight against him, making him more respectable than his brother and uncle. My only minor complaint is that I wish he had a little more screen time just to explore his character a bit more, but this is still one of the best and most memorable villains I have seen in years. Austin Butler is definitely a force to be reckon with between this and Elvis.Dune: Part Two is one of the best sequels I have ever seen. It is also one of the best moviegoing experiences I ever had. I got to see it on a pretty big screen with a pretty packed theater filled with older people and when the movie started, the chatter vanished as the audience became silent for nearly the entire film aside from laughing at a couple of moments of humor. It felt like we were all mesmerized by the film. As soon as the movie, there was some applause and a lot of chitchat about what happened in the movie. It was such a great experience because it feels like the audience was engaged with this movie and I rarely see that with other movies I see in theaters nowadays.I could have watched Dune: Part Two for hours longer. I was never bored or tired in the slightest. I did not want the movie to end. I thought the first movie was fantastic, but this improved on the first in every way in my opinion. This might be my favorite sci-fi blockbuster I have seen in theaters since Edge of Tomorrow. I cannot wait to see the final part of this movie. As someone who has yet to read the novel, I have no idea what direction the last movie will go. As far as the rest of the year goes for film, I think it will be challenging to find a movie I thoroughly enjoyed more than this one.",

    "Review Date": "2024-02-26",
    "Review Content": "It was a packed house for the February 25 fan premiere and the film did not disappoint.Since the first film, several like myself have read the books and now we're going to compare --- because that's what happens when an IP gets famous, i.e. Most of us didn't compare GOT season 1 to ASOIAF when we first watched it.Alia is not in the film. At all, except as a fetus who speaks to Jessica. So of course she doesn't kill the Baron. It actually works out. From a filmmaking point, good luck finding a child who could do justice to the role, even if you age her up.Jessica, in my opinion, becomes the villain after drinking the water of life. She essentially manipulates Paul into become the Mahdi. It was previously ambiguous as to her birthing a son, and by extension the Kwizatch Haderach, was due to love or vanity. This would almost now appear to be the latter. Again, just my opinion, but I don't believe the water changed her, more likely it awakened a dormant ambition.Chani is by far the most improved character from the books. With all respect to Frank Herbert, she didn't really do much. She was the love interest and ultimately the mother of the Tyrant and that pretty much sums up her relevance in the Dune Saga. She is still all that of course, but while she loves Paul, she's an outspoken cynic concerning him being a Messiah. This was a welcome change.Stilgar is exactly what he was at the end of the first book but all that throughout. I am mildly disappointed. Nevertheless, he is the most comedic character.Paul kills the Baron. Chani breaks up with him (kinda). The door is wide open for part 3.Those are the most significant changes from the book. I would encourage anyone to watch it and not allow these to detract from your enjoyment.Everyone did a great job on the film as a whole and of course it's a 10!",

I did miss seeing his sister, and I don't quite understand why they changed that, even though I read the explanation.

    "Review Content": "First Impression:\nInitially, \"Dune: Part 2\" struck me with the same intensity as when I watched \"Oppenheimer.\" It was an immediate immersion into a world so vast and visually stunning. The opening scenes set the right tone, promising an adventure that's both grand and intimate.The Positives:\nThe cinematography was breathtaking, with every shot from the closeups to long shots. The scenes enhanced with CGI created a visually stunning spectacle. The saturated orange hues of the desert scenes were particularly striking, evoking a sense of awe and wonder. Moreover, the inclusion of black and white scenes added a dramatic flair that was both unique and mesmerizing.Florence Pugh, even though she had limited screen time, delivered a performance that was nothing short of spectacular, bringing depth and nuance to her character.Hans Zimmer's score was a masterpiece, echoing the intensity of \"Oppenheimer\" at times that brought tension to the most important scenes, yet standing strong on its own merits. The action sequences with Zimmer's music were intense and brutal, making every moment on screen evident. The sound design, complete with peculiar yet striking effects and risers, was impeccable, enhancing the atmosphere and the tension of the narrative.The costume design was another highlight, especially with the one villains' outfits being memorable for their intricate detail and the other villain costumes which were an occasional minimalist ensemble that added a unique flair.I appreciated the diversity of languages used in the film, adding layers of authenticity and depth to the world-building.Themes of religion and politics were woven seamlessly into the storyline, adding a rich layer of complexity. The voiceover narration added a personal touch, drawing me deeper into the narrative.The Mixed:\nWhile Timothée Chalamet's performance had its moments, it felt somewhat lacking in emotional depth, resulting in a portrayal that felt a bit mediocre at times. The character development was uneven, with some arcs feeling rushed and others vague, which detracted from the overall impact of the narrative.Moreover, the portrayal of the villains was, on one hand, visually stunning, but, on the other hand, the acting was disappointingly generic, with their defeat feeling inevitable and lacking in suspense.This film overall managed to be complex and chaotic, which was challenging for me to watch and comprehend the details, yet, still utterly captivating, and it felt like a horror film.The Negative:\nUnfortunately, similar to the previous installment - \"Dune: Part 1 (2021)\" - the direction and pacing of \"Dune: Part 2\" were its weakest points. The storyline felt scattered, with moments of confusion and rushed character development. Despite the improvements in pacing compared to the first film, it still struggled to maintain a cohesive narrative flow.Conclusion:\n\"Dune: Part 2\" is a film of contrasts, where breathtaking visuals, outstanding performances, and a mesmerizing score stand against the challenges of pacing and narrative cohesion. Despite its flaws, it remains a breath of fresh air in the landscape of modern cinema, offering a complex and immersive experience that's hard to forget.My rating of 8/10 reflects this dichotomy: a recognition of its unparalleled achievements in cinematography, music, and thematic depth, tempered by the critical weaknesses in narrative cohesion, storytelling and character development.Rating: 8/10.",

With the likes of Incendies, Prisoners, Sicario, Arrival and Blade Runner 2049 already in his bag, this epic trilogy inspire from Frank Herbert's science fiction saga has made Villeneuve one of the most creative and interesting filmmaker of 21st century.Dune: Part 2 picks up from where the first one ended where Atreides house suffered betrayal from the Emperor himself and got annihilated from Arrakis by the evil forces of Harkonnen led by Baron Vladmir (Stellan Skarsgård). Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) unites with Chani (Zendaya) and the Fremen army led by Stilgar (Bardem) while seeking revenge against the conspirators who destroyed his family.This parts focusses on the ways of Fremans and their obsession with the legend of Lisan-al-Gaib. Javier Bardem's portrayal of Stilgar, a Freman blinded by his faith is one of highlights of this epic. Chalamet too shines as Paul Atreides who's trying to live up to the expectations of prophesy. Austin Butler and Florence Pugh are fresh entry to this star studded franchise.As expected, you are up for a worth remembering cinematic experience with nothing but perfect visuals and soundtrack. Hans Zimmer had to break his long term collaboration with Nolan in TENNET so that he could be a part of the film adaptation of his favorite childhood science fiction novel. He surely justifies his commitment by giving some breathtaking scores.All along a must watch in IMAX screen!!!",

Its a tremendous piece of cinema and everyone should go see it on the big screen.",

I did not see Austin Butler...he was bought into his role as Feyd so well that I couldn't take my eyes off of him when he was on screen. Rebecca Ferguson's performance was so nuanced and subtle it gave me goosebumps at times. And the ending...powerful and heartbreaking all at once. Well done! This is a master class in epic filmmaking and hits all the right spots. One of the rare occasions when I've walked out of a theater and wanted to walk right back in and watch the film again. The only thing that would've made this better is if I could've watched part one as a double feature!",

The absolute best parts of this film are the several quiet moments, containing huge emotions and stopping the time before some world-changing events.But as was said, the movie contained a complex story which in some other cases would've been divided into two separate films. Some development happened so fast that the audience were still on the previous planet while the movie already jumped to the next one. I felt like I couldn't enjoy those Villeneuvishly spectacular scenes as much as they deserved to be enjoyed. A second round with this movie is definitely coming for me.",

    "Review Content": "Dune: Part Two was definitely better than the first. It was even more epic. There were parts of the movie where there was a lot going on at the same time that was a little hard to keep up with, but I still didn't feel as confused now as I did during the first movie. The directing was fantastic as always with Denis Villeneuve. The CGI was more or less perfect. Completely stunning, especially the sandworms. And the score... Just awesome. The cast and acting was phenomenal, except Christopher Walken as the emperor. Somehow he feels too silly to be emperor.Dune: Part Two has very good and interesting character development. Especially when it comes to Paul Atreides. The love relationship between Paul and Chani was also very good and interesting. You really root for them, and it's tough to see that it might not work between them, because Paul needs to develop into a leader that Chani doesn't like. Austin Butler was amazing as Feyd-Rautha. What an interesting villain! Really good build-up for the final battle between Paul and Feyd-Rautha. It was a really exciting and well done duel. I love when there is no background music while a duel like this is taking place. It feels more epic to just hear the sound effects of blades, punches and grunts from the characters. Javier Bardem was very funny in this movie. He was so excited throughout the movie that Paul might be Lisan al Gaib. I laughed several times.What I liked more about Part Two is that even though it is part of a series of movies, it stands firmly on its own. Part One had a first act and a second act and then ended very abruptly. Part Two had a final act, where you feel that the film actually has an end even though it sets up a third film. And I can't wait for the third movie...",

I prefer the first film here but this second part is a truly unique experience. I'm a fan of the slow burn of the first one, this one feels very much like a large scale action movie. Some lesser directors would've made this film instead of a two parter. By that I mean I could see another director, like Lynch(83), condensing the first film into narration and dialogue and just going for the action of this film. There's very little of Villeneuve's trippy long shots. Very little of his patience and silence. This film is still spectacular and visually stunning. I really loved this movie. It doesn't feel like nearly 3 hours, it moves, its pacing is great.",

    "Review Date": "2024-03-03",
    "Review Content": "Director Denis Villeneuve's \"Dune Part 2\" picks up the narrative threads seamlessly from where its predecessor left off, delivering another visually stunning and emotionally resonant chapter in Frank Herbert's legendary saga.From the mesmerizing landscapes of Arrakis to the intricate political webs woven among its inhabitants, Villeneuve masterfully captures the essence of Herbert's richly imagined universe. The film's visuals, once again, are nothing short of breathtaking, with sweeping desert vistas and intricately designed spacecraft that transport viewers to the heart of this expansive world.Timothée Chalamet's portrayal of Paul Atreides continues to impress, as he navigates the treacherous waters of power and destiny with a maturity beyond his years. His chemistry with Rebecca Ferguson, who shines once again as the fierce and enigmatic Lady Jessica, adds depth to their complex mother-son relationship.Newcomers to the cast, including Zendaya as the mysterious Fremen warrior Chani, and Javier Bardem as the charismatic Stilgar, breathe life into their respective roles, bringing a fresh energy to the ensemble.One of the film's greatest strengths lies in its ability to balance grand spectacle with intimate character moments. While the epic scale of the story is undeniably awe-inspiring, it is the human drama at its core that truly resonates. Themes of identity, loyalty, and sacrifice are explored with nuance and depth, inviting audiences to ponder the complexities of power and the nature of destiny.Hans Zimmer's haunting score once again elevates the film, perfectly complementing the grandeur and emotion of the narrative. His use of leitmotifs and sonic textures adds layers of meaning to each scene, immersing viewers in the world of Dune in ways both subtle and profound.The second installment of Denis Villeneuve's \"Dune\" saga not only builds upon the foundation laid by its predecessor but also delves deeper into the intricate politics and ideologies that shape the universe of Arrakis. As the power struggles between the noble houses intensify and the specter of war looms ever larger, the film navigates the murky waters of ambition and betrayal with deft precision.One of the film's most striking aspects is its attention to detail, both in its world-building and character development. From the intricacies of Fremen culture to the Machiavellian machinations of the various factions vying for control of Arrakis, every aspect of Herbert's universe is brought to vivid life on the screen. Each character, no matter how minor, feels fully realized, with their own motivations and desires driving the narrative forward.The cinematography, once again, deserves special mention for its ability to capture the otherworldly beauty of Arrakis while also conveying the harsh realities of life on the desert planet. From the towering sand dunes to the windswept sietches of the Fremen, every frame is a visual feast for the eyes, immersing viewers in a world that is at once alien and familiar.At the heart of the film lies the character of Paul Atreides, whose journey from reluctant heir to messianic figure is at once epic and deeply personal. Timothée Chalamet's portrayal is nothing short of mesmerizing, capturing the internal struggle and external pressures that define Paul's transformation with remarkable nuance and subtlety.The supporting cast, too, deserves praise for their performances, with each actor bringing their own unique talents to their respective roles. From Oscar Isaac's stoic portrayal of Duke Leto Atreides to Jason Momoa's charismatic turn as Duncan Idaho, every member of the ensemble contributes to the film's success, adding layers of complexity to an already rich tapestry of characters.Of course, no discussion of \"Dune Part 2\" would be complete without mentioning the film's thematic depth. At its core, \"Dune\" is a story about power - who wields it, who seeks it, and who ultimately pays the price for its pursuit. Through its exploration of themes such as colonialism, environmentalism, and the nature of prophecy, the film invites audiences to reflect on the timeless questions of ethics and morality that lie at the heart of human existence.In conclusion, \"Dune Part 2\" is a triumph of both storytelling and spectacle, a rare cinematic experience that manages to be both epic in scope and intimate in its emotional resonance. With its stunning visuals, compelling performances, and thought-provoking themes, it stands as a testament to the power of cinema to transport us to worlds beyond our imagination, while also challenging us to confront the truths that lie at the heart of our own humanity.",

It easily surpassed part one and took care of all the weaknesses the first film had. There's nothing I like better in the first film which is saying just how good part two turned out to be. The cast was just as good with the recurring characters and added new ones like Butler who played a phenomenal villain. I was also blown away by the color usage this time around. It felt like the entire color spectrum was used throughout the movie giving an incredible viewing experience. The stadium scene being completely black and white gave the whole scene such an eerie feeling to it. A true masterpiece by Villeneuve. 5/5 stars.",

    "Review Content": "Dune Part TwoI had the good fortune of seeing part one only a few weeks ago, so the story was fresh in my head when I sat down to watch this one. I was very happy to see a lot of people in the theater at 10:30 am on a Saturday. Being surrounded by fellow science fiction fans was something I had missed.This movie was amazing. First I want to celebrate the fact that Lisa Gerrard did some of the vocals in one of the greatest movie scores I've ever experienced. I think the last movie she worked on was Gladiator nearly 25 years ago, and her voice is still perfection.For a film based in the desert, the cinematography still managed to capture the multifaceted landscapes over sand dunes, caves, cities and the genius work with those giant worms.The plot continues immediately where part one left off, and it hardly spent a moment recapping. If you haven't seen part one, then that's on you. While watching the movie there were parts I was expecting to pick at when I wrote this review, but they all were answered before the close of the movie.Religion, prophecy and destiny are heavily featured as the main themes. Paul is concerned that blind religious fanatics will do too much while following him, when he only wants to settle down as one of the Fremen. The entire Bene Gesserit faith, with the devious Reverend Mother in the lead, uses those themes as a way to control and direct all of the ways of the empire. These were touched on in the first film, but now we get to see how they play out.I won't spoil anything, so there's not much else left to say other than run, don't walk, to the theater. Movie theaters need support, and blockbusters like this cost money to make. As a man who grew up in the 1980s and 1990s, today's fantasy, sci fi and comic book action movies are a dream come true for me. Both Dune films are epic and deserve credit for continuing to bring \"nerdy\" escapism to the forefront of people's minds when choosing a movie. Bringing the debate of prophecy and action taken, as a chicken and the egg commentary, is also welcome because the fans have always known how deep these stories can get.Last comment: Don't drink anything before hand. This film is very long, but worth every minute.",

    "Review Content": "There is something about Dune. You either dig it or you don't. I dig it. In fact I love it.Dune came out as a novel in 1965, it is set in the mind bogglingly distant year of 23,352 AD : ten thousand years after mankind has overthrown the intelligent machines it created.The demon of AI has already been conceived and defeated. So unlike a lot of sci-fi this story is about people and not about their clever machines.It could easily have been set during the Crusades. It has grandeur, it is expansive. It is complex.It is about belief and faith, it is full of religious fervour, about survival against the odds. It is also about revenge and justice.It is about careful manipulation, sowing the seeds of prophecy; nurturing it , of plans that span 90 generations. About knowing when to seize the moment when that time finally comes.But at the same time it is about a hero fully aware of what destruction that may bring.Dune is influential.If you've watched the Star Wars films, Dune's reluctant hero living on a desert planet with a looming empire and the battle for the galaxy will feel familiar. (After the success of the first Star Wars film , Lucas termed himself too big to sue).I have read Dune many times. I have watched the David Lynch film more times than I can remember. In fact I have watched Dune part one about five times.The casting in this version is perfect. The effects are impressive and on the big screen the sound immersive and there is some really quite striking imagery.Dune has almost become a holy book for the sci-fi fan of a certain age, it even has a messiah. I am that kind of fan. Watching it has become a religious experience. You feel like you are watching the prophecy you know so well come true. That makes it powerful.That makes Dune part two simply superb.",

Amazing cinematography, score and stunning performances. Timothee Chalamet, Zendaya and Rebecca Ferguson deserve Oscars.The scenes shot in IR are some of the best cinematography to exist, period. Dune: Part Two captures the essence of the book, and elevates it to an art form that is beautiful, terrifying and utterly breathtaking.There were scenes where the raw power of the film and score led me to tears. This movie deserves Best Picture, and so much more.However, I do have a few gripes. Firstly, the relationship between Paul and Chani was one of calm and trust in the book. Here, it was one of doubt and mistrust. That is a bit sad to see, although it does add significant tension into the relationship, which may become a pivot point in the future.Also, many scenes were omitted, particularly for length decisions. However, not getting to see Hawat, or the decadence of House Corrino and the Golden Line Throne was a bit of a shame.That said, Dune: Part 2 is a work of art. I will be watching this film again and again. It is a reminder of what can be achieved when pure passion and love is dedicated into a rich, complex and beautiful source material.",

I know that is a very grandiose thing to say, however I think it is most definitely warranted.\"Dune : Part Two\" is so close to perfection. Denis Villeneuve is a modern day great director, that cannot be contested anymore. He is up there with the Finchers, Nolans and PTA's of the world. He has delivered a film I think that only he could have achieved. Every single tiny element to this film, is made with such care and attention to detail its truly breathtaking. His directing is sublime. His uses of massive scale, action as well as very intimate moments are all truly wonderful. Nothing is overused or left to waste for that matter. Every part gets its moment to shine. The world, language, technology and characters he has adapted into this film is unlike anything else I've seen on screen.However most importantly of all, this film fulfils everything set up in Part One. Both films compliment one another so perfectly, however Part Two going deeper, bigger and more epic than ever before.Denis Villeneuve you are a king!Everything within this film is pure perfection. CGI, practical effects, action, acting, production design, sound and story. All of whom couldn't be any better.I could name every single actor in this film for being so amazing and to be honest they all do deserve that. Sadly this review would be 4 times as long if I did that, so I'll stick to a few standouts. Firstly and obviously is Timothee Chalamet, the guy is yet again building his career into quite something. I don't think there is another actor of his generation that could pull this off. Perfect casting! Rebecca Ferguson and Stellan Skarsgard both truly great. The surprise for me though was Austin Butler, who was fantastically horrifying. Especially his early scenes in black and white, gave me goosebumps. A true villain that actually felt threatening.I am totally lost for words with how incredible this film is. However I do have one minor problem with the film even though that might seem impossible. For me the pacing and editing every so often is a little uneven. To be honest that is me really knit-picking.90% out of 100 this film will go down as one of the greatest Science Fiction films ever created, I truly believe that. Not only that, I feel it will become an instant classic. This is the definition of epic cinema!",

It must say a lot if Christopher Walken is the one that worked the least for me (he still worked, by the way),\nAnd so much more.But unlike the first part, there are also a few issues or at least questions I have with this one:\nSometimes I thought the criticism of the religion was a little too in-your-face. I feel like the book handled this more delicately. It sometimes even felt a little tacky.I also wonder how the structure of this movie holds up if I had not read the books or if I look at the movie with a little more distance.My biggest concern, though, is how the main change from the book - the alteration of the dynamic between Paul and Chani - will work out in the end. I feel at the moment that this was not necessary, and I felt that the dynamic between them in the books, especially considering the last line of the first book, was way more interesting.I wonder how I will feel about this movie the next time I watch it.For now, I'm still far from dissappointed, a little overwhelmed and I'm pretty sure that I will rewatch this movie quite a lot!",

In the book her child is already about 3 - a far more plausible timescale.No changes to the movie would have been needed except adding the birth and the character of Alia in a few scenes - the key one being the between the Baron and the Emperor.Also, Chani is shown as opposing Paul and leaves him, the opposite of their relationship in the book.It's hard to see how a sequel can make these changes fit the storyline while keeping it intact.",

    "Review Content": "I think everyone has just come to expect complete hack written formulaic garbage from Hollywood to the extent that when something good does come out it's treated like\nIt's the Mau'Dib of movies.The first movie felt like a beautiful 2+ hour trailer. In part 2 there was obviously a great deal more development and yet there were several pockets of the movie that just felt like a waste of time. When things were happening they felt rushed and undersold and when they weren't they just dragged on.For example - Paul's pre born sister Alia felt wildly underwhelming. And she's one of the biggest reveals of the books. I also felt like Villeneuve left maybe a bit too much on the cutting room table. Part 2 felt oddly g-rated. The violence was largely bloodless like a marvel movie and intimate scenes were shot from the shoulders up.Dune is far more adult than that. Personally that's what I've been \"thirsting\" for. A movie like this made for adults.Performances were by and large well done.Chalamet turns in his usual subdued but strong performance.Zendaya seems a little out of place this time around now that she actually had a role rather than only being in visions. She mostly reminded me of an angry 12 year old boy.Javier Bardem and his fanatical Stilgar were great and once he becomes a believer you can see Bardem really start to have fun.Rebecca Ferguson is still by far the strongest actor in this series. Every shot she's in - you just don't blink. She's absolutely mesmerizing.Josh Brolin does his Josh Brolin thing. Serves his purpose.Austin Butler, you can tell puts alot of work into his roles. He does well here.Florence Pugh is more like furniture to me. Like everything I've seen her in I know she's there but I'm not really paying attention to her. In Oppenheimer I realized I was ignoring her when she was on screen and I wasn't even doing it on purpose.Which leads me to my problems with this cut of the film - Pugh and Christopher Walken just felt empty.There wasn't enough time spent trying to understand them. Less b-roll of the desert and maybe more focus on character development would have been good.Why would the emperor kill Paul's father who was like a son to him? I know they explained it but it didn't feel... enough. I didn't know or care enough about the character or his motivations to feel genuine. Even if his reasons were manufactured by a certain group and exacerbated by his own pettiness, fear, and jealousy. This is a movie. This is Show not Tell.With all of that being said - Dune Part 2 is by far the best thing to come out of Hollywood in years which is why people are freaking out like it's the 2nd coming. We're so deprived of quality and not original but fresh filmmaking that we'll worship anything decent.Oppenheimer made a Billy(yes bc it was tied to Barbie) and that was literally nothing but people talking for 3 hours in different rooms.

    "Review Content": "Just returned from cinema and decided to write down my impressions while they are still hot, rather than wait and contemplate.I was sorely tempted to give 10 - this is way better than anything that came out of Hollywood since... well, since Dune 2021. However, just because something is better than its context, it doesn't mean it's absolutely perfect.Did part two bring a nerdy tear to my eye like part one? No. While part one delivered everything (minus some Tom Bombadils) that was in the book plus some scenes which weren't there but undoubtedly happened, part two makes some compromises and liberties. It's not as accurate as the TV miniseries but it's in the same league. (I'm not even going to mention the Lynch's movie which even Lynch himself didn't like.)The second half of the book (and the second part of the miniseries) takes place over years. This movie takes place over months, which is ridiculous. That doesn't give Paul enough time to become a proper Fremen, it doesn't give his relationship with Chani to solidify, etc. I do not understand this compromise, especially when (in this particular case) they could have utilized the narrator more and skip over longer periods of time as needed.The movie (unlike the book and the miniseries) never explains the source of the spice, which I consider to be a major omission.On the other hand, while this movie cuts some content which was present in the miniseries, it also covers some book content which wasn't (or couldn't have been) in there. Hence, while there is a large overlap, both the movie and the miniseries deliver something the other does not.The ending reaches a little bit beyond the book. While the book provided a solid ending, the known lore of the franchise tells us that it was merely a beginning. This is reflected in a rushed way typical for almost everything else in this movie.All in all, very good work. I wonder where are they going to take it next. Book two would be a logical choice but maybe they'll cover Brian's work first (after al, he co-produces this).",

Splendid cinematography, beautiful visual, perfection from start to finish.I haven't read any of the books, but it seems as though that is irrelevant to the experience.I was so disappointed with myself for not seeing Part One in the theatres, but I promised myself that I wouldn't deny myself of this wonderful experience.Timothee's acting was absolutely remarkable and deserves multiple nominations, but I was most impressed by Zendaya. I feel like she put in the best Big Screen performance of her career. She was phenomenal from start to finish.",

It brings forth everyday social issues, complex psychological questions, & spiritual tension all into one. The sound & action captures you into a world that seems very much like ours but with the twist of a galactic empire. Each character is created to bring their own sense of theatrical value. The cinematography is brilliant. Does not feel like CGI whatsoever. Almost felt too real at times. I'm captured, dumbfounded, deep in thought & absolutely mesmerized by this franchise. This film really blew my mind & I will be rewatching it again. GO SEE IT ASAP. NOW. THIS. IS. REAL. CINEMA.Maybe the best movie ever made?",

The cast were really amazing, every single one but the stand out was Austin Butler who played his villainous role to perfection, he was cunning and brutal and his performance was just so intense. The whole film was quite brutal actually especially with more action scenes too and the sound designs were brutal aswell, I can really see why it's been compared to the empire strikes back. Every scene was golden, the acting, the visuals and the cinematography again on point but even better this time showcasing some fantastic epic action scenes and sandworms being seen a lot more. The movie was just so damn intense I loved it so much and the feuds between the houses and Paul getting to this Messiah role was just such a great story. The dialogue in this was so engaging and rich I loved every line. The new characters and lore were a treat and added to the story perfectly. The score was brilliant and elevated the scenes. It ended better than the first to set up the next one too and I'm so hyped to see more I can't wait, I think Villeneuve might be one of the best directors of our time and this movie should be nominated for many oscars cause it was perfect! Overall this is a perfect movie that is so thrilling and so damn intense to watch and is masterfully crafted across every area of filmmaking.",

Christopher walken as the emperor was so outstanding. Florence phug who I saw at the Santa Barbara film festival playing Princess Irulan and daughter of the emperor was a better character for her than Oppenheimer. The story was good . But after reading the book it was very different. The ending was different in the book . The emperor talks to lady Jessica's daughter to see where her brother is and she knows he was coming and they take her somewhere where they have to find her . Chani stays with Paul and lady Jessica after they kidnap the emperor and his daughter. Paul accepts his marriage to the daughter of the emperor. The sand worms were a big help . But now Paul and his army must travel across the galaxy to start a civil war . Will the war rage on and on . I'm positive it will or won't . Paul must face the ultimate challenge accept the marriage to the daughter of the emperor or come back to chani and make a decision to her. I didn't know the baron was Paul's grandfather and Fayed was Paul's cousin . The book I think mentioned something about that. I'm so shocked and surprised Paul's family is related to the villains in the movie. In the book it's the same thing . The baron is related to Paul's father and I knew in the first movie he was related to the baron . Frank Herbert had so many Easter eggs in dune chapter one and two . In the book same thing.",

    "Review Title": "Brilliantly continues this highly engaging story without ever once letting up on what made the preceding film so great in the first place",
    "Review Date": "2024-02-29",
    "Review Content": "Dune: Part Two\" is the sequel to the 2021 science fiction film \"Dune\", based on the 1965 novel of the same name by Frank Herbert. Directed and co-written by Denis Villeneuve (\"Incendies\", \"Prisoners\", \"Arrival\", \"Blade Runner 2049\") and starring Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, and Rebecca Ferguson, it brilliantly continues this highly engaging story without ever once letting up on what made the preceding film so great in the first place.After the fall of House Atreides at the hands of the House Harkonnen, Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) find themselves joining up with a native Fremen tribe on the desert planet of Arrakis. In an effort to gain the Fremen's trust, the two undergo a series of challenges, with Paul learning their language and taming the large sandworms, and Jessica drinking from the Water of Life to replace the tribe's dying Reverend Mother. Over time, Paul develops feelings for Chani (Zendaya), a young Fremen woman whom he had been seeing in his visions, and the pair start working together to prevent the Harkonnen from harvesting all of the spice on Arrakis. It soon becomes clear that the Harkonnen will stop at nothing to steal all of Arrakis's most prized resource, and while Paul wrestles with his personal emotions, he plans an effective way to stop them before the entire universe itself is placed in mortal danger.Without any doubt, the 2021 film adaptation of Frank Herbert's first \"Dune\" novel has proven to be one of the most engrossing science fiction movies to be released in the past few decades. Cleverly alluding to the real-world history of trade, this film takes that very concept and places it into a futuristic outer space setting with the underlying social commentary that hostility between different cultures will always remain a problematic concept. Due to the sheer scale of the story being told, it would be impossible to tell this epic tale within the confines of a single film, which resulted in it being split up into two parts. In this long-awaited second half of the story, the plot continues in an incredibly well-made science fiction masterpiece that retains everything great about the original and more.Like its predecessor, this film does a fantastic job of captivating its audience within the first ten minutes and maintaining that level of intrigue the entire way through. We watch as Paul and his mother Jessica work together with their new Fremen allies to overcome a potential ambush from a group of Harkonnen soldiers. Rather than attacking the enemies up close, the Fremen are observed sniping them from a safe distance, using their own wits to dispose of them without drawing too much attention to their location. Later, as Paul and Jessica strive for acceptance among the Fremen, we are shown each of the painstaking ways the pair try to exert themselves to win their favour.Paul's taming of the skyscraper-sized sandworms proves to be a challenging task, but once he masters it, the audience is treated to an incredibly exciting sequence that is certain to leave a lasting impression. This later leads to him bonding with Chani, who admires Paul for his commitment to the right cause and the two start to harbour romantic feelings for each other. On the other hand, Jessica's journey is more of a spiritual one, with her taking on the role of the Fremen's new Reverend Mother. By consuming the mysterious \"Water of Life\", Jessica gains the ability to hear the memories of all her ancestors, allowing her to become an important figure for both her son and the rest of the Fremen. The two contrasting journeys to enlightenment are balanced perfectly alongside each other, allowing for a necessary emotional undercurrent for the thought-provoking themes scattered throughout the main story.We also learn more about the Fremen themselves, whose lifestyles were only hinted at in the first film. Far from the uncivilised \"rats\" that they are labeled as by the Harkonnen, the Fremen are an interesting group of natives who have learned to adapt to the hostile environment of Arrakis and live in harmony with the other dangerous creatures. However, it is also established that there are some disagreements between the Northern and Southern tribes over which lifestyles they should all be following. I interpret this as the film's way of alluding to real world religious disputes over how someone's personal beliefs will always clash with others, which is shown to still be a problem thousands of years in the future.If the story doesn't invest you right away, then the film's amazing visuals are sure to do the trick. All too often, I see films that use CGI as a way to distract the audience from its faults but here it is all implemented flawlessly as a method of advancing the story forward. I often found myself in awe at the fantastic use of cinematography for even the most trivial of scenes. For example, as a way of showing how small the human presence on Arrakis is compared to the planet itself, there are moments where we see the large building settlements being dwarfed by the size of the huge sand hills in the background. And if that isn't enough to get the point across, the even larger sandworms just might pop up from underground to devour anyone or anything unfortunate enough to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.Also, despite being a desert planet, the appearance of Arrakis is never a dull sight. Spice glimmers brightly in the hot sunlight and the film's creative colour palette allow it to effectively reflect the particular mood of a scene that would have otherwise become straining to the eyes. But it's not just Arrakis that is impressive to look at, as there are other locations that brim with visual brilliance as well. The Hardkonnen homeworld of Giedi Prime has noticeable shades of black-and-white that give the planet a militaristic vibe in the vein of a World War II propaganda film, complete with marching soldiers wielding emblematic flags. Additionally, during some sword fights, the film even starts to resemble a classic samurai feature, in particular those by the legendary Akira Kurosawa. Just when I thought I was becoming desensitised to dazzling visual effects, this movie has proven me wrong.But perhaps the best part about all of this is the film's pacing and editing. Even though it clocks in at a whopping 167 minutes, at no point does the film ever drag or contain any unnecessary filler. Director Denis Villeneuve has masterfully used his skills to combine all of the film's aforementioned strengths into a perfectly paced story that is able to simultaneously wow the audience with its great visuals, immerse them in the atmosphere of a faraway planet, and keep them invested in what happens to each of the characters. One scene where this is prominent is during Paul's attempt to tame a sandworm. Here, Paul places a device into the sand that is used to attract them to his location and waits patiently for one to appear. The suspense of whether or not a sandworm is going to suddenly appear out of the ground without warning is so cleverly done that I could not take my eyes off the screen during this whole sequence. There aren't many filmmakers capable of pulling off a scene like this, but Villeneuve is clearly more than qualified in this particular area of expertise.As I said about him in the previous film, Timothée Chalamet is perfect in the role of Paul Atreides, whose importance in the story has increased significantly since last time. Watching Paul grow closer to the Fremen through Chani is a solid emotional anchor for his character, and helps him become more sympathetic to the audience. As Paul learns more about the Fremen, the audience is learning along with him, and the film never skimps on the details regarding what he needs to do to win their trust. Even Paul's character arc is more interesting this time around, as we watch him wrestle with his conflicting emotions and the stoic pragmatism he trained for all his life.Zendaya also stands out as Chani, who has a more prominent supporting role teaching Paul everything he needs to know about her people. Though Chani is more than capable of handling herself in combat, she and Paul nonetheless make a great team together, allowing the two of them to grow closer romantically. Rebecca Ferguson plays a larger role in the story as Lady Jessica, not only as the mother of Paul but also as a new maternal figure among the Fremen. Without revealing any important details, Jessica's character provides an almost supernatural quality to an otherwise grounded story as a result of her consuming the Water of Life.Much like last time, this second part of the story that began with 2021's \"Dune\" has found a way to go all out to entertain its audience at every opportunity. It draws you in with its fantastic visuals, keeps you invested in its intriguing plot, and also provides some insightful commentary on the general nature of human behaviour. This film is an epic in every sense of the word; both in scale and narrative. There are still five other \"Dune\" novels written by Frank Herbert with the potential to be adapted into feature films, so I remain hopeful that this one is not the end. Judging by the success of both this film and its predecessor, there is a bright future ahead of us.I rate it a very high 9.5/10.",

It's a time when anticipation built up for months, if not years, before a major film's release. I particularly enjoy that it's once again similar like back in the days when you were genuinely excited to await a movie's release. The kind of excitement that had you marking calendars and planning movie nights with friends or family. As a hard-working man, finding joy in such simple pleasures has become rare. I can enjoy a trilogy again as if I were a fan, just like in the old days, finding myself in a world so vast and stories so compelling that for a moment, the outside world fades away. It makes me feel young again, reigniting the sense of wonder and endless possibility I had back then. This movie is brilliant, not just in its execution but in its vision. I love how they incorporated Islamic prophecies. It's a testament to the film's commitment to not just entertain but to educate. And I believe this movie is more than just fiction and entertainment; it's the future.",

    "Review Date": "2024-03-03",
    "Review Content": "Dune Part 2 is a breathtaking visual extravaganza that not only provides the next chapter in the Dune Universe but also takes you on a spiritual journey. The film begins where the last film left off,We see Paul and his Mother Lady Jessica integrate within the culture of Fremen and just like the first film the culture and customs of the Fremen are explained seamlessly. They have their own language,their religion and prophecies,the way they value and preserve water is also explained. The cast just like the last film is phenomenal and everyone just crushes it on the screen. Timothee Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson once again carry the emotional heft of the story perfectly as Paul Atreides accepts his place as the Messiah while Lady Jessica becomes a spiritual leader to the Fremen because of her Bene Gesserit past. Javier Bardem and Zendaya get to shine as Stilgar and Chani respectively. Stilgar's belief in the prophecy and it's implications is conveyed exceptionally by Mr Bardem while Zendaya does a great job as Chani a brave fremen soldier who loves Paul but is constantly at loggerheads with the prophecy. Austin Butler as Feud Ratha stands out immensely. He is ferocious, blood thirsty and a psychotic maniac. Florence Pugh as Princess Irulan is contemplative and devoted to her father but does not have much to do in the story. The cinematography in this movie by Greg Frasier exceeds expectations and it should definitely be watched on the biggest screen possible. This film also has a lot more action than the first film and the action scenes are visceral and very entertaining to watch on the big screen. This film overall is a satisfying conclusion to the story setup in the first installment even though this film definitely sets up future installments. The score by Hans Zimmer is epic which might be an understatement but the score arouses you when Paul ascends and take his place as the Lisan-Al Ghaib. The score during the action scenes will also pump you up. Director Denis Villenueue understands that despite the epic scope of this film it still is Paul's journey and he takes it to fruition here. An absolute sure shot recommend, One of the best cinematic experiences I've ever had.",

    "Review Content": "8.7/10 (Definitely Recommend)I wish I had actually rewatched \"Part 1\" so I could remember the gripes, connections, and the feel for what's next. Despite my lack of preparation for \"Part 2\" I came out of still full of enjoyment, but not as much as I had for the first film.The pacing for me is my biggest negative. From the appearance of what I watched there's a \"Part 3\" to come as well so this film is setting up for that. I bring that up because I didn't have as much excitement watching this movie. The final battle was enthralling, but it didn't motivate me to cheer for or against anyone.The acting was good and the chemistry carries over from what I remember. I like Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya, but neither of their performances really griped me for the emotional parts. There may have been moments when I felt connected, but they were stretched.Visually this film is spectacular. A lot of attention to the details is definitely display. Obviously there would've been a lot of VFX used to obtain 98% of the scenes, but it feels natural. Nothing feels overtly out of place and that includes the giant worms.The film also sounds amazing. Unfortunately the theatre I went to has a lot of blown speakers so the sound quality was less than impressive at times, but I could definitely make out what was trying to be achieved. Once again Hans Zimmer crushes the score and brings you into this vast imaginative world.Overall, despite some of my peeves I admit that it is a great movie. Not as enjoyable as the first film for me, but it's worth the time in the end. The story is good with build-up that I can appreciate. This film is more than two actors and they all nailed their parts well. The effects and sound are spectacular, but the flow of everything might throw some off. Ten minutes longer than the first film and I felt it. Still, I would see it again granted I check out the first film first.That's all for now. Thank you for taking the time to read my review. Until next time.... Enjoy the show!",

    "Review Content": "My fresh impressions from the pre-premiere speak of this most hyped piece of the current decade as an accumulation of the very essence of cinematic artistry and a demonstration of original visual spectacle like nothing seen before.Denis Villeneuve's new masterpiece, which many have even dared to call the greatest film of all time, truly justifies such accolades at moments. The direction of some scenes, their scenography, and the mythological monologue accompanied by Timothy Chalamet's incredible performance is something that sent shivers down my entire body as scenes unfolded before my eyes, captivating me in a trance that truly elevates cinematic artistry.Unlike the first part, Part Two is filled with numerous action sequences whose choreography is again something we haven't had the chance to see often. But... Despite all my excitement for the film, and as a big fan of the first part and the book, I must disappointingly say that this is not entirely perfect or the greatest sci-fi film of all time. I wanted the grand final showdown, which was completely neglected in the book's description, to be presented here at a level greater than anything we've seen so far, and, it was close to that, technically very close... but temporally insufficient.In conclusion; \"Dune: Part Two\" is another magnificent masterpiece by Denis Villeneuve in the adaptation of the cult book. A film that truly pushes the boundaries of the genre and something that, if you enjoyed the first part, you must see on the big screen or the largest screen available!\"Long live the fighters!\" 10/10.",

Sound design/score and visuals were so honoured by the theatre in a way I've never experienced. I'm at a bit of a loss for words other than generational, masterpiece, theatrical cinematic experience like nothing I've witnessed before. Loved the books and they did such a wonderful job capturing the source material. What's so interesting is how the book is so internal in its presentation. You experience the story from the mind of the character. In the film, the dialogue is there to support the film, which is primary here. The visuals, the cinematography, the sound, the score are all the story, and the dialogue is there just to help deliver that. It's so complementary to the book by doing it this way by becoming the projection of what took place in your mind as you read the story.Well done. Still riding the high. It will take something truly special to replace this as my new #1.",

The narrative is all about the increasing complexity and darkness of the choices facing the lead characters, and like both the book and other Villeneuve films it has no qualms about not answering all the questions it raises.The second is the pacing - I'm not sure there's a two minute sequence in there I would have cared to miss.Finally this is a Dennis Villeneuve film and you absolutely getting his trademark sensational visuals!",

    "Review Date": "2024-03-01",
    "Review Content": "Bold statement incoming: the combination of 'Dune Part One' and 'Dune Part Two' has officially become my favorite film adaptation of a book. The profound impact of Frank Herbert's epic 1965 science fiction masterpiece on both literature and religion is not to be overshadowed by Denis Villeneuve's visionary homage. This is the book come to life, and if you appreciate the book, the movie should resonate deeply with you.I struggle to think of a better-executed sequel; though 'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'The Dark Knight' are certainly in the running, 'Dune Part Two' excels beyond both. Its strength lies in the combination of jaw-dropping world-building, extraordinary acting, and a script that allows the audio-visual experience to unfold effortlessly. 'Dune' is a spiritual journey deeply rooted in Muslim culture and Western Colonialism's quest for natural resources, which is even more relevant today as it was nearly 50 years ago when the book was written (i.e., \"The Spice,\" which always equated to oil in my mind).Aesthetically, the film has no equal, which is no surprise considering the director's extraordinary track record, including 'Blade Runner 2049', 'Arrival', and 'Sicario', all of which are in my Top 50 films of all time and deserving of a perfect 10/10, along with 'Dune Part One'. 'Dune Part Two' exceeds its predecessor in every way, elevating the story in such climactic fashion that my heart and mind were positively buzzing for a solid 90 minutes. It has no weak link, no tonal inconsistency, and no extended dip in energy or over-explanation in which to lose the viewer. It is a perfect film from my perspective and likely to crack my top 5 all-time (I will reserve final judgment until I can see it in 70mm IMAX next week).",

This must be watched on the big screen for sure.The mixed:\nThe acting varies in quality with performances ranging from excellent (Bardem, Chalamet, Ferguson, Butler), average (Zendaya, Skarsgard) to forgettable (Walken, Bautista). The pacing is also a bit hit and miss, with some parts/scenes feeling rushed (the ending, Paul's transformation into Lisan al-Gaib).The bad:\nWhy, oh why did they completely ruin the relationship between Paul and Chani? It's a key part in the book! She supports him 100% in his decision to marry Irulan and his rise to power. Is it because she must be seen as a 'strong and independent woman'?The Harkonnens have become cliched comic book villains, far from the intelligent, sinister and calculating antagonists of the first movie. Virtually nothing is seen of the emperor and Irulan. They may as well not be in it.The timeline is crammed into about 6 months rather than almost 3 years, meaning that Alia isn't born yet so Paul, not she, kills the baron. Why?! As a two year old she plays a key, and powerful role in the book.After reading some of the 10/10 reviews I'm guessing that many have needed a quality movie like this after the dross of recent years and might be getting a bit carried away in their enthusiasm!",

You will literally never witness something like it if you don't see it on the big screen.Lastly I want to praise Denis Villeneuve. Even if you are not a cinema enthusiast and even if you don't care for things such as the art of directing a movie, the work Denis has done cannot go unnoticed.

Way better than the part one and exceeded my expectations by a huge margin.All the movies in the year will have to play catch up to this level in my opinion.This is what we need from Hollywood, great storytelling.If you watch this this in a cinema and you are not satisfied, I dont think movies are meant for you 😁 Thinking about some of the scenes alone makes me have goosebumps.Definitely go and watch again for a second time.",

Do yourself a favour and see it in the biggest screen near you. Denis' ability to give his films scale was taken to a whole new level in this epic. The weight of the movie is felt in full force with an incredible rumbling score throughout. Masterful Editing & Incredible plot makes this a contender for top 250 movies of all time. This is what Hollywood needs. Saw this movie 6 hours ago and I'm still completely blown away. Adrenaline for days.10/10 !!!!!",

    "Review Content": "Hear me out: I love sci-fi, and Denis Villeneuve is very skilled at creating Dune Pt. 1, Blade Runner 2049, and Arrival. Now we have Dune Pt. 2, which I just saw in IMAX at an early screening last night. It is, as you might expect, a technical marvel with a stacked cast who all bring their A-game. Like The Two Towers or Empire Strikes Back, it expands on the lore, worldbuilding, develops the main characters and introduces new ones. Most of what was set up on the story and character front is paid off to some degree here. The battle sequences are incredible and creative in places. I think it's safe to say that if you liked the first movie, you'll like this one. BUT, it's easier to admire than to love, with the characters at arms' length, even by the time the credits rolled. Keep in mind that while the movie is very good, it still has pacing issues and is too long. In fact, there is so much going on here that it feels like two movies' worth. This is not as great as the hype makes you believe (masterpiece, next LOTR, etc.). But as a sequel to Dune, it works well enough to entertain while suffering from that middle-chapter syndrome that most second chapters do.",

    "Review Content": "Fantastic immersive cinematic experience. Definitely see it on the biggest loudest screen you can find. Villeneuve's direction is the key here, as he masterfully navigates an admittedly obtuse storyline with the sort of operatic flair that pulls an audience in and captures said audience, transporting the viewers to a spellbinding, thrilling crescendo. The mythic elements of Frank Herbert's story requires not only spectacle but gravitas, which Villeneuve understands and implements with solid efficacy, like a painter working with deep, difficult, lustrous oils. And \"Dune\" is that- bold, lustrous, luminous, expressive, massive. We forget sometimes that film is a form of expression, and thus an artform, not just idle entertainment. Villeneuve happily and enthusiastically reminds us with this terrific rendition of Herbert's science fiction classic.",

    "Review Content": "**A Cinematic Triumph: Exploring the Epic Sequel \"Dune: Part Two\"**\"Dune: Part Two\" emerges as a cinematic tour de force, building upon the foundations laid by its predecessor to deliver an epic saga that surpasses all expectations. Directed by visionary filmmaker Denis Villeneuve, this sequel transports viewers back to the mesmerizing world of Arrakis, weaving a tapestry of intrigue, betrayal, and heroism on an unprecedented scale.From the outset, it is evident that \"Dune: Part Two\" is a labor of love, meticulously crafted with an unwavering commitment to honoring Frank Herbert's iconic source material. The film picks up seamlessly where its predecessor left off, plunging viewers into a world on the brink of war as the battle for control of Arrakis intensifies.One of the film's greatest strengths lies in its masterful storytelling. Villeneuve deftly navigates the intricate narrative threads, balancing exposition with heart-pounding action to keep viewers on the edge of their seats. Each character is given ample room to grow and evolve, their motivations and conflicts explored with depth and nuance. Whether it's the charismatic Paul Atreides grappling with his destiny as the prophesied messiah or the enigmatic Lady Jessica torn between loyalty to her son and the Bene Gesserit sisterhood, every character feels fully realized and essential to the story's unfolding drama.Visually, \"Dune: Part Two\" is nothing short of breathtaking. The sweeping vistas of Arrakis, brought to life with stunning practical and visual effects, serve as a mesmerizing backdrop for the film's epic narrative. From the towering sandworms that roam the desert to the intricately designed fremen sietches, every aspect of the world-building is executed with meticulous attention to detail, immersing viewers in a universe that feels both fantastical and eerily familiar.At the heart of the film lies its exceptional ensemble cast, led by the incomparable performances of Timothée Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson. Chalamet brings a quiet intensity to the role of Paul Atreides, capturing the character's internal struggle with poise and conviction. Ferguson, meanwhile, delivers a standout performance as Lady Jessica, infusing the character with a complexity and strength that elevates her beyond the typical archetype of the genre.Supporting performances from the likes of Oscar Isaac, Zendaya, and Javier Bardem further enrich the film's tapestry, each actor bringing depth and gravitas to their respective roles. Whether it's Isaac's portrayal of the noble Duke Leto Atreides or Bardem's charismatic turn as the fremen leader Stilgar, every character leaves a lasting impression, contributing to the film's rich and immersive world.Yet, perhaps the most remarkable aspect of \"Dune: Part Two\" is its thematic depth. Beneath its epic spectacle lies a poignant exploration of power, religion, and the consequences of unchecked ambition. As the various factions vie for control of Arrakis, the film forces viewers to confront uncomfortable truths about human nature and the corrupting influence of power. It's a timely and thought-provoking commentary that resonates long after the credits roll, inviting viewers to ponder the implications of our actions in an increasingly complex world.In conclusion, \"Dune: Part Two\" stands as a triumphant achievement in modern cinema, a sprawling epic that dazzles the senses while challenging the mind. With its masterful storytelling, breathtaking visuals, and stellar performances, it cements Denis Villeneuve's status as one of the preeminent filmmakers of our time. For fans of science fiction and cinema alike, \"Dune: Part Two\" is an experience not to be missed-an unforgettable journey to the heart of Arrakis and beyond.",

    "Review Date": "2024-03-04",
    "Review Content": "I did enjoy the movie, but I saying it's as good as Dark Knight will be a huge overstatement.Enough good things have already been said about this movie, so I'll just point out the negatives:1. All viallians feel quite weak, bland, and never seem to pose any real threat. Bautista's character is a joke, Baron isn't threatening, and the new villian (being called as good as joker by some people) also feels very generic. The *new abilities* that Paul gets also feel too convenient and easy to get.2. Characters change a lot instantly, Jessica suddenly becomes this completely different character, and same goes with Paul.3. I can see how it may have to be rushed in the movie format, but the pacing could've been better.4. Paul is the prophesied prophet, and... That just happens with no surprises etc. In some ways, I think that was for the better, as it avoids the overdone struggling hero cliche, but I was prepared to feel tense for Paul, but never really felt that there was a reason to feel tense.Overall, it's a solid 8/10, it is a technical masterpiece if you look at cinematography etc., but as a movie overall, it's just another 'good watch' which is well worth its time, and that's completely fine.",

The costume design is particularly striking, and the ensemble cast delivers standout performances across the board.However, there are some drawbacks: Around the midway point, something felt off. Rebecca Ferguson and Timothy Chalamet's characters seemed to undergo a sudden transformation, almost as if they forgot who they were. While character development is expected, this shift felt jarring and poorly explained. The pacing also felt inconsistent, with moments dragging while others rushed by. This reminded me of the character arc of Daenerys Targaryen in Game of Thrones, where her evolution felt sudden and unearned. Additionally, the desert setting dominates the film, creating a feeling of monotony throughout. What made Part One special seems lacking in Part Two; there's a sense of missing that extra touch or uniqueness.",

    "Review Date": "2024-03-02",
    "Review Content": "Dune Part Two is an epic science fiction masterpiece that confirms (if it wasn't already clear) Denis Villeneuve's film- making genius. Part One was the build up and this is the payoff. It explores the connection between Messianism, religious fundamentalism, politics and militarism in a way that mirrors our own world. But it doesn't offer any easy utopian resolution, completing a hugely satisfying arc in the hero's journey but at the same time presaging an apocalyptic holy war between the Great Families.Every aspect of the film impresses. The design, the costumes, the tech, the music, the combat sequences, and of course the narrative, for which we can thank Frank Herbert but also screenwriters Villeneuve and Jon Spaihts. When Maud'Dib and the Fremen ride on the back of the giant sandworms (Shai-Hulud) you know your watching sequences that will become cinematic classics. Bless the Maker and his water!All of the cast are back from the first film and there are some excellent additions. Christopher Walken is the Emperor and Florence Pugh his daughter Princess Irulan. Léa Seydoux is great but a little under-utilised as Lady Margot Fenring. The standout addition is Austin Butler, fresh from his portrayal of Elvis, smashing any typecasting to pieces as Feyd-Rautha, the psychotic and sadistic champion of the Sardaukar.One thing I love about both films is that they tell a mother and son tale. Rebecca Ferguson (as Lady Jessica) and Timothée Chalamet (as Paul Atreides) brilliantly explore the negotiated territory between a mother who sees her son in terms of her own prophetic wishes and a son who resists that vision but in the end uses it to carve out his own destiny.If there is one criticism I have (and its only a small irritation) it's the rather poorly rendered mass crowd scenes. They are so obviously computer generated (of course) but they don't look at all real which takes you out of the world you're immersed in. That aside, I have not loved a franchise this much since The Lord of the Rings trilogy, and I definitely want to see it again at the cinema. An IMAX session would be awe inspiring. About as much fun as anyone could hope to have at the movies.",

Denis Villeneuve did it again. He blew my mind.He portrayed the world of Dune in a way I didn't believe was possible. Everything is cinematically grandiose and glues you to your seat in awe.The sci-fi elements of Dune are out of this world, not since the release of the first Star Wars have I seen so many innovative solutions to visualise it. Everything from the Harkonnen desert suits to the mortar ships are things never seen before that excites the mind. This paired up with the amazing sound effects offers a cinematic experience like no other.The movie itself, the storytelling, pacing and the acting is stellar.

    "Review Content": "I haven't been the biggest fan of Jean Villeneuve as there tends to be a lot of visuals but not always as much depth. Dune part 1 didn't quite capture the book, even though the visuals were absolutely stunning. The mood and message of the book didn't come through.Somehow, this time he managed to incorporate much of the book's message, the intricate plots, inner conflicts, and more - while still providing enough good action scenes for the average moviegoer.The casting is perfect with very few exceptions or minor irritations that are not noteworthy. (But I'm unsure if Elvis is believable as the bad guy.) The music is also much more balanced and several notches better than in part 1.To film Dune in a way that captures the book is probably not possible, but this film comes surprisingly close. As a standalone film, this is probably a 10/10, but considering the Dune universe and the author's message, this is a solid 8, which is extremely well done.",

    "Review Content": "An absolute masterpiece.Please note, there are no plot spoilers in this review, but I will talk about some of the main themes.Okay, so...Dune: Part Two is one of the best films I've ever had the pleasure to see in a theater. I saw it in dual laser IMAX, and will see it again in 70mm IMAX. Dune: Part Two might have some of the most incredible sound mixing I've ever heard, too, at least for a spectacle and an epic. You feel it in your bones.The real reason this film is so exceptional isn't the world class filmmaking and visuals, though. It's the fact that this is a multi-layered and complex story that easily could have turned into a tedious slog, but it doesn't. In fact, ignore the fact that this is sci-fi for a moment. This story deals with some of the most interesting and universal themes imaginable. Fanaticism, faith, religion, power, love, tribalism, the rise and fall of empires. It takes an incredibly dense mythology and puts that to screen THROUGH its visuals, not in spite of them. This is how you properly adapt something from words to images.Also, look around at the world today. The themes of this story are as relevant as they've ever been. At heart, even though this is a sci-fi story, it deals with human psychology at its most primal levels. Clearly inspired by the Middle East and the Abrahamic religions, especially Islam (and also Judaism around the time of the Second Temple and early Christianity and the Bar Kokhba revolt), Dune manages to offer the same warning of the books, in perhaps an even more visceral and direct way...Beware of saviors.Holy wars have shaped the real world, yet so many sci-fi stories shy away from dealing with concepts of faith and religion. By embracing this aspect of the novels, this adaptation finds greatness. Especially among other blockbusters, this really is a unique experience. And it isn't done in a simplistic or insulting way, either. The best stories make you think and force you to engage with them, and there are layers to the characters and their struggles.This is not to say Dune: Part Two is perfect. I actually wish it was longer. The last third is a little rushed, and I love Christopher Walken but he may have been a little miscast here. However, the overall film is so exceptional, and it reaches such rarefied heights (like LOTR and Lawrence of Arabia before it), that it doesn't really matter to me that much. With that said, I've also only seen the film once so far, and am curious how repeat viewings will affect my thoughts.Also, I wish this had been made like LOTR, so Dune Messiah was coming out next year. Alas, I get why Denis needs a break from making three epics back-to-back-to-back.Speaking of, Denis is up there with the best to ever do it. Incendies, Arrival, Blade Runner 2049, Polytechnique, Sicario. Like the best filmmakers he has such range, but each film is so unquestionably his work.",

They spent a lot of time teaching cast members how to speak Fremen (a made up language) and how to walk without rhythm to avoid worms but they totally forgot to provide context or back story for the films.So before watching DUNE 1 and 2, watch David Lynch's 1984 DUNE Extended version (a little campy but fun) and/or read the book DUNE or at least the Wikipedia page. Also before DUNE 3, watch Children of Dune 2003.Some factoids from DUNE 1984: In 6041, the universe was ruled by thinking machines and humanity became apathetic and eventually became enslaved to these machines. A religious revolt freed humanity from the machines and forced humans to develop their minds.As the movie opens, it is the year 10,192 and the known universe is ruled by the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV. Each major planet is ruled by the great houses of the Landsraad and their members are part of the royal families. They follow an ancient feudal system of government.Only two mental training programs remain. The Bene Gesserit sisterhood for females with their selective breeding program to produce the Kwisatz Haderach (the Super Being) as foretold in a Fremen prophecy. The other is the Spacing Guild which emphasizes pure math and with the orange spice melange produced on the planet DUNE (aka Arrakis), their space navigators are able to fold space to almost instantly transport objects with their minds which gives them an economic monopoly in the universe. The spice melange extends life, expands consciousness and is vital for space travel and must continue to flow.Two royal houses have been mortal enemies for centuries--House Atreides on planet Caladan ruled by Duke Leto Atreides and House Harkonnen (a ruthless and sadistic people) on planet Giedi Prime ruled by Baron Vladimir Harkonnen.The CHOAM company under the Emperor controls mining of the spice melange on DUNE. The Bene Gesserit and the Spacing Guild are silent partners of CHOAM. The Emperor is fearful of Duke Leto's popularity among the Landsraad and has conspired with Baron Harkonnen to eliminate the Duke and his family. The Emperor has transferred the spice mining contract from House Harkonnen to House Atreides forcing the Duke to relocate his household to Arrakis (DUNE) and become more vulnerable.The Bene Gesserit sisters can read minds, have powers of telepathy and are able to mutate with the water of life. They are trained in a method of hand to hand combat called the WEIRDING WAY and they're able to influence behavior using the VOICE.DUNE 1 & 2 follow the Fremen prophecy of the Kwisatz Haderach (the Super Being who is the hand of God). He will bring peace to war, love to hatred and will free the Fremens and change the desert climate on Arrakis.",

First off you've got to see it on IMax. I don't know if the smaller screen would have the same feeling. The effects are seamless. There's nothing else to say about that. And the story is complete from start to finish. But the thing that really sets it apart is the music and sound design holding hands with the effects and cinematography. It's powerful. There were moments when I found myself mesmerized by the effects and sound and lost track of the story a bit, but the phenomenal performances by Timothee Chalamet and Austin Butler brought me right back and were quite impressive. Zendaya was equally amazing. I don't want to give much away, but there are some beautiful nods to the very first dune that David Lynch directed and I think it's actually better than the first Dune '21 Denis Villeneuve did. He is simply a genious.",

As Paul navigates Arrakis, he faces new challenges and discovers himself together with the enigmatic Fremen warrior Chani, whose relationship with Paul deepens amidst the turmoil of revolution.Visually stunning and meticulously crafted, transporrted me to the desolate yet enchanting world of Arrakis,The cinematography captures the grandeur of the desert planet while also highlighting its harsh beauty.In addition to its visual and narrative prowess, \"Dune: Part Two\" also explores themes of power, religion, and identity with thought-provoking depth. As Paul grapples with his newfound status as a religious figurehead and the weight of his own destiny, the movie raised compelling questions about the nature of leadership and the consequences of such power.Overall, this was a masterful continuation of Denis Villeneuve's ambitious adaptation, delivering spectacle, substance, and emotional resonance in equal measure. With stunning visuals, compelling performances, and rich thematic depth, it was and always will be, a must watch for me.",

Didn't really think it's all that visually impressive, although the sequences that were in black and white stood out a bit more. The biggest problem I have with it honestly is I just don't care about the characters or the outcome of the story. Even the world of Dune isn't that exciting to me.Half of the movie was just groups of people walking through a desert, and it got tedious and dull. Everything else was kind of meh at best or you've already seen it done in other franchises already. Some of the music and performances were fine, but yeah the way this ends means they'll probably be a third one. I've been super disappointed with the hype for this franchise.5/10.",

If your expectations from a movie is limited to computer generated CGI effects and cool visuals, you will LOVE this movie because that's all this movie is about.If you are expecting a movie to go above and beyond that and provide things like a good storytelling, a well written plot, character depth and development, strong dialogue...etc. This movie fails in every single one of them.Good visuals and CGI doesn't make a movie great but most people aren't smart enough to get it unfortunately.

The cinematography is gorgeous, the music and sound eerie and unsettling at all the appropriate moments, the direction is wonderful, and the characterization brilliant, the plot follows the spirit of the books. If you are a fan of the books, there are certain critiques to be had, which are valid from a fan who knows what they're talking about. However, if you are to introduce a newbie to Dune...Part 1 and Part 2 here are a great way to do so. I can't imagine how many people will read the Dune series because of this film. Watching Paul's character arc is worthwhile and satisfying and the main thread of the film. The supporting cast/characters arguably steal the show, which says a lot about them because Chalamet did wonderfully. And yes, all the disappointed Zendaya fans from Part 1 for her lack of screen time, you get to see more of Zendaya in this one. There are twists and turns in the story that will keep you guessing and even leave you feeling deeply unsettled because, well, that's Dune's story. The fight scenes have intense tension, characterization, storytelling, and drama. This movie is a classic in the making, and a sight to behold! Bravo.",

Then the exotic and stunning world of Blade Runner, which only lacked a depth of lore with regards to storytelling. Along with the incredible sound design in each of these films only lacking the originality of lightsabers clashing. DUNE enters the room with the brilliantly crafted ornithopters, the intricate crackle of the shields, and the rattlesnake rumble of an incoming sand worm. Aside from this, the cast is as perfectly selected as Nolan's Batman trilogy, making every character introduction a pleasant surprise and a nod of appreciation for choosing someone so well suited to how you personally imagined they would look and act. Next is the layers of storytelling and depth of plot that really take this movie into the realm of top 10 on the top 250, cementing Villanueva in the Mount Rushmore of trilogy directors and second maybe only to Christopher Nolan. Throw a few Lisan Al Gaib whispers into the chat and some Arrakis DMT and you have a full fledged passion of the Christ meets Qui Gon Gin looking at anakin for the first time.

    "Review Content": "The entire texture of this film is so different from the first, part one with a singular storyline this story fanning out allowing space for characters to unfurl. The pacing moves with these arcs sometimes slowing and at other times hastening but at all times not overdoing exposition and keeping the story moving. The fact that many peripheral characters in part one are given much more screen time is wonderful. I found it of special interest they paid so much to developing out the Fremen culture too so it had its own identity just nothing short of magic.The movie itself is beautiful, the sci-fi immense and strange. Geidi Prime rendered as monochromatic horror. Kaitan lush and decadent. Everything has a visual identity. The beauty of Arrakis made even more dramatic by the terror of the worms and its storms.Politics is at the core of the film though and its interplay with faith, belief and religion. Paul is given a much darker turn his messianic trajectory driving a visible fall from the grace of the Fremen instead an instrument of the political long play of the true power of the Bene Gesserit. Prophecy is depicted instead as corruption of freedom another whip to control the masses. I can't wait to see how this is played out in part three (it has to come too much is left unresolved).This by far is one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time and it deserves every accolade it receives.",

    "Review Content": "I haven't been this pleased with a movie in what seems like years. So often nowadays we see big blockbuster films skip the substance and go for spectacle to what seems like just to make a quick buck. Whether it's a new installment to an old franchise that doesn't need to be rebooted or another lazy superhero film, movies today seem almost disrespectful to the art form that I grew up loving so dearly.But this movie gives me hope. Not only does it utilize its big budget to create a one of a kind visual and auditory experience, it is backed up with an incredible story that comes together so perfectly. Visuals are absolutely stunning and it's obvious the makers of the film took their dear time with creating a visual masterpiece throughout the different settings whether it be in Arrakis, Geidi Prime or the emperors home planet. I mean seriously it is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen.The use of modern technology I think needs to be replicated in the blockbusters to come. Not an over reliance on CGI for action scenes, but used just enough to create a surreal universe that up until now you could only find in a handful of movies throughout the years.The story obviously is legendary. Frank Herbert's story is almost mythical at this point, but it was adapted to screen so perfectly that when it came time for the emperor to arrive in Arrakis, I literally leaned forward in my chair to watch the climax. The way that the three main groups (Freman, Harkonans and the Emperor) come together in the end of the movie just felt so natural and smooth. There was never a time in which I was questioning why characters were making the choices they were making. It just made sense what was happening, the characters behaved rationally and it happened with style too.The first comparison I made to this movie when I finished watching was Lord of the Rings. A book that series that once felt impossible to adapt, but once the role was taken by someone who truly loved the source material and truly loved film (and had the budget to do so), we were treated with a movie unlike anything I have ever seen. This is what a movie can be, if more directors put their heart into a film and utilize modern technology, they most certainly can create a film like Dune: Part Two. I think we are all sick of seeing the same reboots, sequels and cliche superhero movies over and over again, in fact the trailers prior to the movie had me exhausted considering every single one was unoriginal and appeared like a lazy cash grab trying to capitalize on nostalgia. But, this, this is what we have been missing in film the last few years. A film with the substance of the films of the 60s-90s and the spectacle and use of the capabilities of modern times, we can get visual arts forms that prior to now only came about in a few instances (Insterstellar, LOTR, even Infinity War). I hope this sets a new precedent for blockbuster movies, films that seem to actually care about the viewer and not act as a way to stimulate our brain with jumbled CGI fights and plots with more holes than Swiss cheese (like seriously, who wants another Godzilla and Kong movie? Don't even get me started on the movies Disney puts out every year.) This is the type of movie up until now I could only ever dream of, but we're here, and if this is a telling sign of the future of film, it brings me great hope for the rest of the 2020s.",

Zendaya was incredible, balancing out the strength of Chani with the fragility of falling in love with this outsider, Paul and Chani's love was earned throughout the movie, subtly.Timothée was...phenomenal.

    "Review Content": "When you find yourself boarding the hype train, you run the risk of raising people's expectations too much. It's a reason I don't often like to give out perfect ratings straight away... but with Dune: Part Two, I can't think of any way it misstepped or let me down. This could be the best epic movie since The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, or at least the most epic to successfully tell a story on this scale in a flawless way. For as good as 2021's Dune was, it just feels like a warm-up compared to Dune: Part Two, which is where things get bolder, more expansive, and much more morally complex. Dune is to Star Wars what Dune: Part Two is to The Empire Strikes Back; a basically perfect sequel to something that was already great, but is taken to new heights with a second installment.Dune: Part Two is also much better paced than the first movie, which has a lot of set-up to lay out early on, peaks at the end of its second act with a big battle sequence, and then has a slightly strange final act that now feels more like it functions as a prologue to Part Two. Dune: Part Two manages to kind of hit the ground running, but then wisely doesn't try to maintain a sprint all the way. It slows down where it needs to, and then continues to build to a final act that is mind-blowing in scale. I felt like I got goosebumps on my cheeks; I didn't even know you could get that feeling there. I also felt almost light-headed and overwhelmed, but in a good way. Seeing something on this scale pulled off this well comes just a handful of times a decade, if you're lucky.Timothee Chalamet is given much more to do, returning characters are taken to darker places that somehow feel both inevitable and surprising, the special effects are perfectly done, the new characters are great (Austin Butler comes amazingly close to overdoing it, but I feel like he's just the right level of unhinged), and the score/use of sound is incredible; as good or better than the first. Overall, it really does feel like an improvement across the board, wrapping up the first two movies well while giving some indication as to where things could go. It was a film that was worth the wait. Sorry in advance for adding to the hype, but I think it really was that good.",

There are so many moments that will make you have goosebumps, and what more could you want from a movie? The fact that this movie even exists is crazy. The sheer scale of this masterpiece is mindblowing. How can you go back to watching a normal movie after this? It's easier to name a few minor problems than writing 20 pages of praise.This is an all-star cast with a lot of talent. Chalamet is outstanding and he has shown why he is a true movie star. He was frightening on screen. I was ready to bow and call him my king. And Zendaya delivers a masterclass in acting. She is the heart of the movie and her performance moved me. Butler is also phenomenal, but the problem is that he did not get a lot of screen time. When he's there, he is amazing, but he is barely in the film! It was, honestly, disappointing to have such a great villain and performance not be in the movie longer. It was anticlimactic.The whole movie builds up to the final showdown between the houses. It's cool, I guess, but it does not have any real kick. There does not seem to be any stakes. The big action sequences were not as great as the first one. It works, but it's nothing special. The story is the most interesting with Paul's (Chalamet) journey and transformation. Also, the more intimate action sequences, only featuring a handful of characters, are incredible (for example: the harvester scenes and the knife fight).With that being said, this might be the greatest film ever. Everything good is just so great. Never has a movie reached this high before.",

The characters, the actors, their masterful delivery, the settings, the dialogue, the writing, the storyline, the production, effects and photography, the direction; all these things vibrate with a heavy, redolent air of urgency, crisis and gravitas. There is an immense emotive weight behind this movie's production. The primary actors in this tale are powerful and astonishingly well portrayed. The heavy religious backstory which empowers this movie is unvoiced but dominant never the less. Violence, and there is no shortage of that, prevails, but seemingly it is more a response to genocidal repression than a specific ethnic pogrom, or politic strategy.Even so, the response of the Freman to their attackers, is grounded, inherent and succinctly Neolithic in the timbre of its violence. Hand to hand interchanges with sacred blades, the teeth of the massive sand worms, leaves most foes with some serious linkage. Eventually, though, politics does win out. Where the third installment of this series will go, a la the original books' storyline, is difficult to conceive. This is not because it is not written, rather it's because it becomes harder to understand and relate to. At the end of the movie, the humble, self-effacing Paul Atreides seems left behind in the in escapably blind willingness to surrender to his own predestined fate as Emperor. Seemingly, the new Duke has become much more than human.",

I thought it was quite dull and had a huge lack of emotion and the music was incredibly random and loud and so many minutes were wasted on scenery that added nothing to the plot.Well Dune 2 is nothing like Dune 1.Dune 2 is filled with plot progress, character development, action & drama and there are almost no minutes wasted and almost everything was executed brilliantly. I felt like I was in the cinema for a while but still would've prefered it to be double or even triple the length it was just that good.The only regret is not going to IMAX. Movie of the year for sure.",

There is always something happening on screen it is as if the powder keg which was the first movie finally exploded. The fights and battle sequences were one of the best I have ever seen. And To me the biggest achievement of Villeneuve is that he used each and every member of his ensemble cast with perfection. Timothe Chalamet is slowly turning into the next big thing of Hollywood and he gives a career defining performance. Zendeya also proves she is worth the hype. And Austin Butler ever since Elvis he has been on form. Although he didn't get that much screen time his potryal was stunning. Javiar Bardem also acted fabulously. It is rare that every actor gives their best in such a stellar cast. Also Rebecca Ferguson has outdone herself. I cannot wait to watch the Third part on an even larger screen. Dune is the epic of my generation.",

The loud pounding of gunshots, the heavy clanking of swords and knifes smashing against one another. And with the small, hand-to-hand fights, you can feel the emotion, every punch, kick, stab, all of it. The acting was absolutely phenomenal, unlike any I've ever seen before.Timothée Chalamet deserve all the praise he is about to gain from this film. This has to be Chalamet's best performance yet, along with many others. While not his best performance, Austin Butler absolutely delivers in this movie as Feyd Rautha. Not quite living up to antagonist performances such as Heath Ledger's Joker in Nolan's Dark Knight or co-star Javier Bardem in No Country For Old Men. However he is absolutely on the new list of film antagonist. Amongst others such as Josh Brolin, Rebecca Ferguson, and Zendaya, this movie is packed with the greatest performances I've witnessed in a sci-fi film.Greig Fraser, oh Lord where do I even begin. This film's cinematography was absolutely stupendous! I'd put this movie's cinematography on par with such works like Linus Sandgren in La La Land and Roger Deakins in 1917, this movie has the masterful blend of color, angles, and framing. Everything about this movies cinematography set the tones perfectly and I'm one hundred percent here for it.Overall, this has got to be one of the greatest movies I've ever seen and I'd recommend to anybody, no matter your taste in films.",

Sad to say i have not read any books just yet so i'm excited to learn about the other houses, planets and unfolding of the story. It was a long sit but well worth the while.

    "Review Content": "Dune: Part Two is the greatest example of why movie theaters will never die. Going to the theaters and seeing a movie is an event, and it should be entertaining and enjoyable enough to leave a lasting impact. Dune: Part Two does exactly this in a runtime that would be considered long, but never once slows down or loses its quality. The main cast in this film in excellent-Chalamet, Ferguson, Zendaya and Butler deliver top-tier performances that I believe will get their own recognition at next year's academy awards.Villeneuve has already proven to be a fantastic director, but I think he has the chance to be the greatest science fiction director of all time. With films like this and part one, The Arrival and Blade Runner 2049-I think it's safe to say we are in great hands and hopefully the content of the Dune Saga will only grow, and I trust Villeneuve to deliver another excellent picture with Dune Messiah and his next couple of films.If you haven't seen this movie yet, please do yourself the favor of seeing it on the biggest possible screen you can with the best sound. It really enhances the film and its visuals, score and sound. Without movie theaters, we would never get films as grand and epic as this one is, and I don't think anyone should miss out on the opportunity to see this adaptation of Frank Herbert's magnum opus.",

    "Review Content": "Never before have I been this excited for the release of a film. When the delay from November to March for Part Two's release happened, it devastated me. But now it is here. I was able to see it almost a week early and it did not disappoint. I am an avid fan of the books, so I will say that most of my criticisms or slight complaints come from wishing to see scenes and characters from the book adapted on to screen, but at the same time, most if not all, of these changes make for a better paced and probably less cluttered final product.The cinematography once again is stunning. The gorgeous sands of Arrakis mixed with the colors of different times of day, the larger than life presence of the sandworms, the dismal and brutal gray of Giedi Prime, the various sietches and places of the Fremen. All of it looks gorgeous. The Hanz Zimmer score returning, capturing perfectly the atmosphere of this desert planet. Loved all of it.The performances of characters evolve, most notably Timothee as he becomes Paul Muadib and Lady Jessica as she takes on role of Reverend Mother. Zendaya as Chani gives much-needed depth to that character from the book, Javier as Stilgar was incredible. Each performance was fantastic. Dave Bautista also shines in his role as Beast Rabban. I could go on and on about each performance, but another well done aspect of this film.If you enjoyed Dune Part One in any capacity and long to see where the story of Paul Atreides and the Harkonnens goes from here, you will definitely enjoy this film as the pacing feels very quick and action packed and the world-building from Part One makes it all pay off here.So many scenes from this Part Two took my breath away and I think Denis did an incredible job adapting the second half of this epic story, despite several changes from the source material. I will definitely see this film again and again, so I can relive this incredible cinematic experience and if you haven't already, definitely give the books a try, and I look forward to the next chapter: DUNE MESSIAH.",

Unless you are concerned primarily with visuals of course, which is all this movie wins in. The two miniseries are a better depiction of the stories in the books, whereas this film is extremely empty and slow and boring.Part 2 was pop-garbage, a rip off exploiting the story and other stories to change it completely, where it only expanded on its wasted opportunity of part 1 to make a complete waste of time. It's very difficult to recommend this film and its prequel for anything but 'nice visuals'.So, your best bet is to read the books or go and watch the two mini-series mentioned above between 2000 and 2003.",

Visually stunning, with a compelling story featuring well-developed characters and excellent performances.While the first film follows the \"hero's journey\" as we all know it, it left a taste of \"more of the same.\" Dune 2, on the other hand, while still using this storytelling method, twists it in a way that washes away the slight taste of cliché from the first film. And the director executes this spectacularly. It's a \"must-watch\" for any sci-fi fan and undoubtedly one of the best in the genre of all time.Today, I was impressed in the best possible way.

Somehow Paul runs at a soldier in the beginning leaving his mom behind, then to his left another soldier is coming at him only to be hit on the head from behind...hey must be Chani...no it's his mom...how did she get there so fast and unseen?Then Paul has to prove himself by going into the desert, is given a tent etc and told to go. Next scene he's with Chani..ok np...then the next scene his trial is apparently over and he's there and back already...what?Then he's walking up a hill towards his worm calling, the fremen are seated behind him watching him walk up the hill. Then they are apparently now staring at a field and Paul is over to their right? Huh? He calls a worm and it breaks through the hill that he was standing on continuing to the right, seemingly out of eye to the fremen since the hill was blocking there view of the right...yet somehow they appear to see him riding this worm and cheer.Then they attack a spice harvester, hidden under the sand, seemingly able to hide their digging, footprints but hey ok. Then they attack just as they are able to get run over, an ornicopter takes out seemingly 1/2 of them, then Paul and Chani decide to attack it, while some others go to confront other soldiers. The ornicopter stays on Paul/Chani and can't seem to just move around so it can see under the legs and lets itself be blown up, all ground combat seemingly done with swords/knives for some reason. Next attack on a harvester is completed with only a single laser weapon....why have 1/2 the men killed in the first raid if you had that!So many more scenes that just abruptly happen or people teleporting around for no logical reason. Paul comes into the temple to take the water of life, \"You shouldn't be here\", \"I'm here to take the water of life\", teleport to him with different clothes, \"here you go\". Pretty sure when he takes it he had other people with him and it wasn't done so damn quickly.Alia being a fetus throughout the entire movie made zero sense given they showed what appeared to be her quickened growth in the beginning after the water of life was taken, months and months go by in the desert(Chani telling Paul it's been a long time since he's had his nightmares implies their relationship has been going on a long time) yet Jessica never appears to show further than maybe 6-7 months along...Alia never being born and not killing the Baron. Why??I give this a 6 because despite all these terrible edits/choices the movie is still striking visually, and the costume design was fantastic, but wow...just wow to the above.",

    "Review Content": "Where to begin... Wow. The scale of this movie surpasses everything: the action, the performances, the music; everything is perfect. The film picks up where the previous one left off to create what could feel like a war behind the screen. It feels so real; emotions flow throughout the projection, from beginning to end.We witness Paul's growth to become the promised Messiah, and as he does, the terrifying sensation caused solely by the idea of what is to come is chilling.Feyd-Rautha is terrifying in a very explicit sense; he is unpredictable and sadistic, truly relishing it, and Austin Butler portrays him magnificently. But the figure of Paul, played by Timothée Chalamet, feels like oppression itself, of a much more powerful and sinister evil, truly terrifying. Yet his more human side is not overlooked, as we see his suffering from the fate that falls upon his shoulders. To not dwell too much on interpretations, I must simply say that there is not a single one that disappoints; they are all truly magnificent.Hans Zimmer picks up where he left off in the Part One and elevates it, providing a sense of epicness, without neglecting the mystique. The visuals are incomparable; the effects are polished to the smallest detail, making you believe in Dune, in Arrakis, and in the entire world built by Frank Herbert, and shown through Denis Villeneuve's vision.Lastly, regarding this, it can only be said that this great director continues to improve; he always surprises for the better. With this film, he brings his sensitivity, which has already made him stand out, to tell the most epic story of his career, perhaps his greatest challenge, and he has succeeded; what seemed impossible, he has achieved.I truly feel fortunate to have seen this movie in theaters; it was a sublime experience. I hope that, just like the book did in its own right, this movie becomes a benchmark for propelling the future of Sci-Fi in cinema.",

All of us would happily have watched it again immediately, there are so many small details and elements to love.Do yourself a favour and go to the conema and see this.I think the third film may not be so good as the third book not so great, being set 12 years after the ending of part 2 when paul is on power for some time, but I am still looking forward to it.People are comparing this film to Dark Night and Empire strikes back. That is not Hype, I agree.

The VFX is brilliant, the art style seems to be leaning in between Geiger style for all Harkonen Architecture and Doug Chiang for all the vehicles ... Costumes, VFX, environments there is nothing to complain about there... The script for Paul and Chani is written well, you can feel the chemistry between characters as well, Rebecca Ferguson does well playing lady Jessica, her storyline was intresting to follow... There is one point however where Villeneuve Dune could do better than it did and it's lord Vladimir Harkonen, now don't get me wrong, the acting of Stellan is brilliant, but his script lacks clever plotting and scheming, his script is very straight pure evil, I don't doubt he should be evil, but instead of melancholic evil they could do a sociopathic evil which plots and schemes and comes up with clever ideas to do evil, instead it felt like lord Harkonen is so done with everyone...

The contrast between one black and white scene and the rest of the movie being colored was a brilliant move and really leaves the audience's mouth hanging and hair standing up in suspense. There are many twists/surprises in the story and they are all executed flawlessly. I never felt bored in this movie. The action scenes and the sword/knife fighting scenes were also very well choreographed and it was definitely refreshing to see. This movie was much better than Dune Part 1 in terms of story, cinematography, CGI, and everything else, and this movie definitely sets up Dune 3 in a perfect way.

Most performances were great but some a little flat.Glad to see the return on Gurney but it felt thrown in and not like a huge deal which was a shame. Austin Butler gave a good performance and his character was interesting but hardly used.The best scenes were those where the Fremen disrupted Spice production but the end fight was very anticlimactic. A very brief scene shows Paul planning the attack on the Emperor's forces, I thought this would lead to an extended action sequence but about 30 seconds of fighting is shown and some worms. Felt rushed which was a shame as it could have been amazing to see the Fremen actually fight.I would still highly recommend this film, however I think the hype around it raised my expectations too much (looking forward to part 3)",

I missed seeing a movie worth the trip to a cinema and I have lived throughout every moment of it.They did justice to the book, it is so beautifully filmed and created, and the music complements every scene. They also managed to send the correct messages from the book who are still so valid or even more important nowadays. And to be fair the young cast also rose to the occasion and did well for their characters. It was beautiful to watch and impressive to hear.One might say it feels too slow paced at some point but it is for a good reason, and what comes next is explosive. I love it.",

    "Review Date": "2024-02-27",
    "Review Content": "This is a return to big cinema that passionately screams the heightened possibilities of big-scale filmmaking. Dune: Part Two is a masterful film in its ability to capture the imagination. While sci-fi, the only \"aliens\" you will encounter are the inhumane humans you are forced to accept as humans. An all-time character study of the human race and its faults. There is a power here that tasks the audience with quiet-car-ride introspective questions.How does religious fanaticism corrupt mankind, and how is this human condition controlled?What does \"revenge\" mean, and how far should one pursue it? To what end?When do hopeful beliefs turn into blind faith? And does this inspire goodness, evil, or something else entirely?With this film, Denis Villeneuve easily places him into the coveted conversation of the greatest sci-fi directors of all time. Here, he crafts a world that oozes mythology and philosophy, sprinkled with excellent action set-pieces.Extremely timely, but timeless in its commentary of who man is. Not only a visual feast to enjoy, but something that will leave you challenged: something rarely experienced nowadays.",

    "Review Content": "Christopher Nolan described the film as Denis' The Empire Strikes Back and once you see the film, you understand why... It's an absolute cinematic masterpiece! A film that stuns you with its cinematography, gives you goosebumps with its music and leaves you in awe with its performances.Denis Villeneuve's filmography and how it gets better with every film is simply remarkable, and probably he's got the best one yet with Dune Part Two. His sense of direction and his vision for the film and franchise is beyond anything and it shows... you can see the grandiosity, and yet the stillness in so many of the scenes.The story (for those who aren't aware) keeps getting bigger as it progresses, and the film keeps levelling up! The silence is golden because then the shots can speak more than the dialogue. There are also scenes which amp you up like nothing else.Alongside that ride, is Grieg Fraser with the best cinematography you can see on the big screen, especially the IMAX screen. Every frame is a treat to watch, the details, the scenes, everything. There's no small or big scene here, everything is a cinematic experience, the still scenes and the magnanimous moments.Timothee Chalamet is showcasing his best work here and we aren't talking about it enough already... There's a stillness, and stoicism in his performance, but also ferocity and hunger, the combination of elements that bring out the best of him on the screen and elevate his performance.While Zendaya's role seemed more of a supporting one, rather than a lead one, it is an important role where much of her performance is through her eyes more than anything else... and there's so much power in that.You cannot talk about Dune Part Two and not talk about Rebecca Ferguson, her command over her character and the power-packed performance she has delivered, you're in awe every time she's on screen.Javier Bardem, Florence Pugh, Christopher Walken, and Josh Brolin are all exceptional... but there's another standout name that yet again delivers brilliantly, Austin Butler. What a scene-stealer! His voice, his look, his personality, a fiery role in this already exceptional cast.The impact Dune Part Two makes is incomplete without the music of Hans Zimmer. Literal goosebumps are what you're able to feel, the elevation that it brings to the scenes and how you're able to feel what's about to come only with the music is extraordinary.There are some films when you say, \"This is Cinema\"... and this is one of them. In such instances, even if there are a few flaws here and there, you don't want to notice them when everything else is so good and so many elements are appreciable at such high capacity. You cannot watch this film just once.",

From opening scene to end credit every second is worth it.. Epic score by Hans Zimmer elevates the experience, filled with beautiful shots and cinematography to a great scrrenplay and some top notch acting by every cast member Dune 2 will be remembered as one of the best films of this generation even after 50 years later that's my guarantee.. Denis Villeneuve is one of the best director of this generation who gave us masterpiece like Blade Runner 2049 and currently working on 3rd part of this trilogy which I can't wait to see.. Action scenes were great featuring big ships, blasters laser guns and every other kind of weapons, sound effects were amazing but most importantly screenplay was well paced and story featuring blend of sci fi and fantasy elements is absolute best of the best even though it is an adaptation of 1965 novel of same name it is one of the best adaptations ever.. I loved both movies and can't wait to see what happens in future because I enjoy films about The Chosen One Prophecy like Star Wars, The Matrix and now this..\nI won't give any spoiler here and will not talk about anything shown in the movie since you need to see this movie for yourself to feel the magic.. Don't miss it at any cost.. Watch it on the biggest screen possible especially IMAX to enjoy epic sound effects and see the larger than life picture you'll love it..",

And now he's quoted as saying, I hate dialogue. That's for theater and TV. So no movie ever has had a memorable line? Where did this guy learn the art of movies? From the Keystone Cops? Hates Dialogue? Well it shows in this miscast and poor adaptation (I hated the boring Part 1 as well), where there's too much emptiness and silence, along with parts he doesn't make clear (the audience laughed at how the terribly miscast Chalamet is being taught how to walk across the desert by the equally miscast Zendeyah so they don't attract worms. The worm itself, along with the technology and costumes were horrible looking. Did they pay off all the reviewers? I can imagine Den of Geeks giving it a great review, since they are the modern equivalent of Starlog, and kiss butt on everything popular. They rarely have any reviews, just like the positive ones for this movie, that say anything. Wait for it to stream or, if you are a fan of Dune, find the Sci-Fi channel adaptation and watch that.

Or did we watch the same story before in many forms? Matrix maybe? Prophecies, chosen ones and dreams offer same type of premises.Austin Butler's villian portrayal is nowhere close to Ledger's Joker or Bardem's Chigurh but still PRed agressively as so. Chalamet is a big OK as protagonist. Zendaya is the weakest part actingwise and her California accent doesn't help the spice planet. Villeneuve's directing is maybe flawless but still relies way too much on visual and sound. Zimmer's soundtrack is intense and original as always lifting up scenes one level.The only difference between Dune and Rebel Moon are a better director and fat studio budget in real. Is it good? Yes, it is but a 7/10 at max. Nothing more.",

The film is even more grandiose than the first, with actors, music, and visuals that are as powerful as ever, memorable and thrilling for over 2.5 hours.Blending religion, politics and romance, Villeneuve's script takes just the right amount of time between action scenes to convey the complexity of Frank Herbert's universe. I left the cinema breathless, having not seen such a complete science fiction film for a very long time.Go to the cinema as soon as you can, because the experience is unique.And for the lucky ones, go for the IMAX!",

The characters are complex and the protagonists are not just good, they don't have a clean slate. Everyone has his own agenda.A few things have been changed from the book, but subtly and, in my opinion, for the better! The role of the female characters, and especially the Bene Gesserit, has been significantly enhanced. That fits well into the story. In the books they were too passive, too small for me. The Bene Gesserit are incredibly powerful, and it makes sense to put this in the foreground. Jessica and Chani also have significantly more personality, act more independently and have their own ideas.The ending is not a sweet Hollywood-typical everything will be fine now ending. There will be at least one more sequel. The material will not be easy to implement on film if you know the books and the rest of the story. But so far, Villeneuve made an outstanding job!",

    "Review Content": "First and foremost the movie is a masterpiece. The vast majority of the poor reviews come from hardcore book fans (disclaimer: I'm one) complaining about variations from the book. I won't elaborate on details to avoid spoilers but what needs to be understood is that it is a different media. Decisions were made by Villeneuve to suppress elements that are present on the book to allow a better flow of the story without compromising its main plotline. He has succeeded in my opinion. Including all the components of the book would inevitably lead to underdeveloped storylines. Another reason for one of his most criticized decisions is obviously technical. Yes, I'm talking about a certain key book character that \"appears\" in a different way in the movie. This character would have to be done in CGI or with an actor dubbing another. I believe both outcomes would be subpar in comparison with how it was handled.For those who have not seen the movie (having read the books or not): go! Make sure you select the biggest available screen (I went for IMAX) and buckle up for the ride. Enjoy your trip to Arrakis.",

Denis Villeneuve goes all out in this second part of what looks to be one of the best Sci-fi film series (if not one of the best film series) ever.The film starts unpacking the amazing story of Dune where the previous film introduced us to. It is not neccesary to see part one to enjoy this film, but it definetly makes the experience more complete. Villeneuve took everything from part 1, but made it bigger and better.Where the previous part was lacking on emotional level and action, this one completely makes up for it in it's 2 hours and 45 minutes runtime that feel less. It is filled with more depth in the story with as main point the struggle of Paul chosing between his foreseen destiny and his own loving desires, while getting revenge together with the Fremen for the brutal destruction of his family.To top it off this film comes with a couple of plottwists that keep you at the edge of your seat, aswell as new characters portrayed by an amazing cast that give outstanding performances together with the great already known cast of Dune Part One.All in all, this is a must watch for every film fan, especially in cinemas where Hans Zimmer takes you straight to Arrakis with his once again otherworldy, amazing score.Dare I say this second part of the Dune film series comes close to perfection. 10/10.",

These distractions were few, far between, and reassuringly made right at every occasion in this film.It was clear that the added time (over two films) that the 1984 version didn't have gave opportunity to DV to cover almost everything the book has to offer.A feast for the eyes and the ears, simply a great return to big screen cinema, more like this would tempt me back to a Limitless Card.

The book is near and dear to me and, regardless of the changes made from the book, 10/10 doesn't quite do it justice. Sure, I could knit-pick, but any issues I might have are more than made up for. Sometimes you can just feel the reverance and dedication an artist has for the craft and faithfully adapting a classic story. What a time to be alive. Faith in cinema restored completely. Zendaya's Chani, though she doesn't impact the narrative much, frames the thematic structure better than in the book and has a forceful presence and voice that can't be silenced. Chalamet effortlessly maneuvers between the quiet, reserved child of privilege and the crazed messiah willing and able to destory anything in his path. Javier Bardem brings the deep reverance, teacher, philosopher, and comic relief elements seemlessly. I don't know where to stop with the cast, so I'll just leave it there. The whole cast is wall-to-wall bullet proof. Absolute feast for the senses. Definitely see it in imax if you can. I could go on for days. Two thumbs up with a tear in the blue-within-blue eye.

As most reviews note, Thufir Hawat is omitted entirely from Part II, a key change from the novel. Mostly I love Villeneuve's alterations, and I understand that Hawat's place probably gets expanded in a potential Part III. So this reviewer abides the deviation from the novel.Also, Alia. I can't wait to see what Anya Taylor-Joy brings to an adult Alia in a sequel in several distant years. Her role in Part II is severely truncated, although she gives away much of what will happen in Dune Messiah and Children of Dune, not that most film-goers will catch it.I know this sounds ridiculous, but this film just seems too short to tell the long journey of teenage Paul to the adult antihero Muad'dib who coldly murders Baron Harkonnen and rips the throne from the Emperor.But even though I feel this way, what Villaneuve gives us is richly satisfying as a pair of heroic, action-packed, hard science fiction films very much in the spirit of Frank Herbert.",

I rarely leave a theatre feeling as though I've witnessed the birth of a new classic but Dune: Part Two does everything to ensure its place in cinema history. It's everything film can possibly be but more importantly it's everything that it should be.Villeneuve takes all of the world building and character development he established in the first film and just runs with it from the get go but not in the way that I expected. I certainly wasn't expecting a faced paced movie but I was amazed and just how much Villeneuve took his time in setting up this second chapter. We get a lot of one-on-one time with these characters both before and in between the jaw dropping spectacle on display and it represents a complexity of character and perfectly developed conflicts that we haven't seen to this degree since The Lord of The Rings.We're really about an hour in before the war that's being set up truly begins to come to ahead and because of the immense amount of time taken to build up these character and stakes nothing feels anything less than perfectly realised. Despite all the set up from the first film, Part Two effortlessly builds upon and expands this world in ways that are both visually sumptuous but also perfectly developed from a writing perspective. The visual effects are astounding, the use of scale is incredible and it has some of the best battle sequences ever put to film all of which come to ahead in an all-timer of a third act. It's one for the history books and it's only going to further cement the legendary status that this entire cast and crew are operating on.I haven't read the book because I wanted to experience this entire story through the eyes of Villeneuve and despite knowing some of the broad strokes of how this thing concluded, nothing could've prepared me for the way in which this story perfectly unfolded and was brought to a close. I left the theatre truly shaken and feeling as if I'd seen something that I couldn't fully comprehend upon a first viewing and it's already left me with a burning desire to go back and experience it for a second time. One of the highest praises I can give any film is that I'm saddened I'll never get to experience it for the first time again and I can't remember the last time I was this excited to see the conclusion of a trilogy.I definitely need time to fully digest the experience that was Dune: Part Two but as of now I can truly call it a masterpiece in every sense of the word. There's nothing present in this film that doesn't feel as if it's operating on peak form and if this whole thing doesn't represent filmmaking perfection then I don't know what does. The hype surrounding this movie did not oversell this experience at all, I don't think anything could've fully prepared me for this and I know as of now that it won't just go down a phenomenal theatre-going experience but really just a memory worth cherishing.",

Dune: Part Two is about Paul trying to gain the trust of the Fremen, at the beginning of the Movie there were many that believed Paul was the Messiah, but there were also many that didn't believe it. Anyway the final act of the Movie is by far the Best part, it includes a lot of action and breathtaking visuals. The acting was also incredible, the acting of the first Movie was already pretty great but the acting in this one is even better. I also loved Paul's character development in this one, seeing him go from being just the Duke's Son to becoming an all knowing hero who can see the future was incredible to watch. Overall Dune: Part Two truly is amazing, and it's definitely the Best Movie of 2024 so far!",

I don't want to spoil it for you, because I want you to go to this movie. So here are my thoughts.Few sequels are better than the first, this one is one of them.This was shot wonderfully, you can tell they spent every dollar to make you feel like you were on another world. The action was great. My main critique with the first one was that it was a little slow, I didn't get that from this one. The battle within Paul's self really comes through on the screen. There wasn't one bad performance in this movie. This movie should be the new standard that all movies should try to reach. Make a great movie and people will love it!",

    "Review Content": "There is not many near 3 hour films I could sit through and stay not only entertained but totally connected to the story. This film went beyond my expectations. It is hard sometimes making a sequel and living up to the first movie but it did just that. I totally agree with the Director that you could watch the second installment without watching the first but you would be missing out. Everything from the cinematography, sound, music to the story itself, I was awestruck by the finished product. Though the film does start out slow, it quickly picks up and runs with it. I very much look forward to part 3 as it leaves you with much more to the adventure still to be told. In my opinion, this is by far one of the greatest films I have seen in recent years.",

    "Review Content": "I wasn't the biggest fan of Dune: Part One but I wanted Denis Villeneuve to have the opportunity to build on it and his sequel delivered in every single way.The scene was set from Dune Part One and we picked up where we left off. To this end, Part Two benefits from the foundations laid by Part One. The factions are set, motivations clear and the movie is a direct consequence of everything that occurred in Part One, if not thousands of years before. That being said, this film isn't lazy when it comes to building the world deeper. Past characters evolve, new characters appear, motivations become clearer and we get a deeper understanding of how the world works including the different people, religions and weapons. I cared for the characters in a way that I didn't in the first film. Chalamet, Zendaya and the ensembled cast all have their moments to shine but that is another discussion.However the story is only half of what made this one of the best IMAX experiences. The action set pieces and fight scenes were so well done. The visual are amazing, everything on screen looks real. It's as if somebody filmed a real life place. Set design, cinematography, costumes are all off the charts. It will sweep up a tonne of the technical awards at the 2025 Oscars. If you thought the Sandworm set piece in Part One was good, Part Two takes it no another level.And despite all of that, the best part of the film might be the sound design. It was relentless and it enhances every second of the film. I don't recall a better sounded film. The desert, vehicles, weapons... Every second you hear something going on and it keeps the world alive.It was a lot to pack into 2 hours and 46 minutes and certain parts move quicker than you would like, for example the third act, whilst others might feel some of the moments outside of the action scenes a little slower. I didn't have the highest expectations for Dune: Part Two but of course they were blow away as if they got hit by a Sandworm in the desert. This should be experienced on the biggest screen with the best speakers!",

    "Review Date": "2024-03-02",
    "Review Content": "This film does a good job picking up right where the first part left off.The story does feel like a continuation of the first film and not a separate story with the same characters. The beginning of this film continues the world building that it started in the first movie. This film is dialogue heavy but there is never a piece of dialogue that feels unnecessary. More characters are introduced which further expanded the plot and made the story more interesting than the first film.I enjoyed all of the characters although sometimes Austin Butler's voice did sound a bit forced. The standout was Timothée Chalamet as he was able to use a range of emotions to further develop his character in the story.The special affects were great and all of the action was entertaining. The music and the sounds were very effective. The colors and costumes are also nice to look at.Although I really enjoyed this film I wasn't blown away by it. I wasn't bothered by the pacing of the film but did feel some parts could have been trimmed down.Having never read the books and only seeing the first film this is turning out to be an interesting franchise. I enjoyed how the film ended and how it sets up the next part.",

I don't even know how many times I got the goosebumps; it was everything I hoped it would be.The only two things that could have made me rate it a 9 instead of 10, would be:1) the lack of vulnerability from Zendayas character. Would have loved to se her open up a bit more - especially around Paul - instead of almost only the tough impression she has going on.2) The introduction and portraying of Emperor Shaddam could have been a bigger thing - like Baron Harkonnen and the way he is being portrayed.I will gladly pay to watch it a second time in the theater, to be honest.What an experience - LOVED IT - 10/10.",

    "Review Title": "A Sandstorm of Cinematic Brilliance",
    "Review Date": "2024-03-05",
    "Review Content": "This is a remarkable feat of a movie that sets the bar very high for future sci-fi films, especially targeted towards mature audiences.Dune Part Two is an exemplar of a great 'show, don't tell' film. It treats its audience very intelligently. It knows you're wise enough to get the gist of every scene. It gives you just enough exposition and leaves the rest for you to think. It lets you experience the almost 3-hour journey by yourself without shoving down information into your throat or telling audience what everything means like you're reading a description from a book.Using a lot of religions and beliefs to support the base of the story, the script (and novels) really takes inspiration from Islam. The terms, the costumes, the designs, a lot of them resemble with the intricacies of Islam. Even the story moves in a way that was inspired heavily by Islam. There was even this one scene in particular, that the idea, strategy and the art of war were borrowed by the true story of the Conquest of Mecca, how Prophet Muhammad gave Mecca the freedom it needed from the influences and practices of the ignorance.Tis has got to be the most gigantic film this year. Yes, we know it's only February but damn, the scale of this film is so epic, you would feel the need to have an IMAX screen that is 10 times larger than what we have now. It's super massive and the camera shots really emphasize the scope the way it meant to be. Greig Fraser, the Director of Photographer knows his way in-and-out of the desert. He knows how to capture the perfect angle; the arc shot, the one shot, trucking shot, close-ups, extreme close-ups etc. He's a master at enhancing our experience by using different types of shots. He truly knows what to do with the camera. This is not a generic Hollywood filmmaking. This is art at its finest.As this film heavily emphasizes on the 'show, don't tell' approach, we have to admit that a few tiny parts had us confused. There were some things that felt unclear to us. There were things that we felt, 'Well, maybe if they could have explain to us just a bit more, we would have gotten what they were trying to tell us'.Similar to Dune Part One, Dennis Villeneuve masters at crafting environments and atmospheres that are just rich with textures, depths and dimensions. When you see it, you can feel it. When they are in the desert, you can somehow feel the warmth of the basking Sun even if you're seating cold at the cinema. When sand touches Paul Atreides' face, you can feel the sensation. When Shai al-Hulud makes an appearance, you can feel how mighty this beast is. Everything feels realistic. There's a certain weight this movie carries that immerses you completely in its world.Austin Butler nails it in his role. Out of all, he's the most outstanding. He is a vile creature that kills others for sports. His charisma is top notch. And his character alone is captivating and chilling, leaving a lasting impression on the audience. Butler's portrayal adds a layer of complexity and intensity to the film, making his scenes particularly memorable.Let's talk about the climax battle. It's ah-mazing. It's a Godzilla-sized scope that demands the widest shots you can ever possibly get. But here's the thing; it fails to maximize the build-up and scope of the action. Just when you thought things are about to get very very exciting, it ends there and moves forward with a smaller scope. All the scope they have created can be stretched with longer action scenes, specific choreographies, more spectacle visual to get the good pay-off. Tone down your expectations for the climax, if you're expecting Lord of the Rings or Infinity War duration-like action, you're gonna be underwhelmed.Timothee Chalamet's performance here is outstanding. But, we have a slight issue with his character's arc; Paul Atreides. His arc graph is well-written, up until the final 30 minutes where we felt that his character gave a bit too much emotions that don't jive with his overall arc. Towards the end, his emotional intensity escalates quite abruptly, detracting from the otherwise seamless development. While this film is already long, we felt that if they could have extended another 15 to 20 minutes to give breadth and depth to his character in the third act, it would be complete and... we would even say, sacred.His counterpart; Zendaya feels a bit lost here. She's great but she couldn't really carry her role. She's the lead, playing a prominent character but she seems superficial when she's with Timothee, which is about 80% of her screen time. She doesn't know how to balance her character with Timmy. She's timid. She appears 'less skillful' than what she's supposed to do. She doesn't understand when to give and take the spotlight to and from Timmy. Again, she's great but her acting here is just not on part with Timmy.New characters in this don't really do much for us. Well, some of them do like Stilgar who appeared at the end of Part One. But others like Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh) and Margot Fenring (Ley Seydoux) are unfortunately underused. First, their initial appearance of these characters are quite bizarre. They just sort of appear. They could have done a better way at hooking the audience with richer contexts. While the existence of the characters are important to drive the story forward, their roles feel rather superficial and lacking in depth. It leaves us much to be desired. Hopefully, they'll have more screen time in Part 3.Verdict: A cinematic tour de force, Dune Part Two is an immersive and exotic odyssey that epitomizes the enchantment of storytelling on the big screen. An epic oeuvre, it worms its way into complex narratives and Godzilla-sized dunes with a scale and scope so vast, it doesn't fit an IMAX screen. Yes, there are flaws but a novel adaptation of this magnitude is bound to have sand grains in the wind. Nevertheless, Dune Part Two's grandeur and ambition remind us why cinemas exist in the first place. This is a sandstorm of cinematic brilliance.",

The world building is spectacular, the fights are action packed, the emotional weight in certain scenes is palpable. The actors all played their rolls flawlessly with stand out performances by Timothy chalemet, Austin Butler, Javier Bardem and Zendaya.

Star Wars Universe's the dark side versus light side conflict, Game of Throne's game changers and playmakers, LOTR's wisdom...\nYou will find what you are searching for.

    "Review Date": "2024-03-03",
    "Review Content": "After Dune 2021's bait-and-switch (\"oh did I forget to mention it's only the first half\" cackles Denis), I had high hopes for Dune: Part Two. I really, really wanted it to bring the story together and blow my mind.Well, it didn't. It's more like Dune: Part One than I expected. And not in a good way.Let's start with pacing. It's slow. Oh my word is it slow. The first 90 minutes are taken up with quasi-religious disagreements among the Fremen about whether the prophecy of a saviour is true or not. Most of this is in a non-English dialect so be prepared to read a lot of subtitles. Villeneuve can film an underground stone temple and scores of hooded followers like no-one else - but don't fool yourself that this is good material.After a long wait, we are finally introduced to some of the new characters that are going to bring this chapter to its conclusion. A common theme is that the big names that came on for the second half are barely used. Austin Butler's portrayal of the unhinged Feyd Rautha is great. He is introduced in a striking visual setpiece. But I wanted more of him. Christopher Walken is well cast as the Emperor but it is a small role. Florence Pugh has very little to work with, and two-thirds of her scenes are essentially narration. Lea Seydoux must have shot her scenes in a day. Anya Taylor-Joy probably shot her scene in an hour after visiting Denis at his beach house a couple of weeks before the premiere.The cast really misses the humanity of Oscar Isaac and Jason Momoa. There is far too much Timothee and Zendaya - and to be honest, they aren't strong enough actors to carry a film of this scale. Villeneuve spends most of his time doing slow and meaningful zooms into their lovely faces as they stand on windswept sand dunes.Now in its defence I will say that a handful of the \"action\" scenes in the film are striking, in particular, an early Fremen attack on a spice harvester, Feyd Rautha's debut in the colosseum, and Paul Atreides' final contest in front of his rivals. Nobody can create a cinematic feast quite like Denis - it looks and sounds fantastic. But the large scale battles are disappointing, starting and ending suddenly, and with a level of destructive power that makes you wonder why the rebellion hadn't happened sooner.I watched Dune: Part One at home the day before watching Part Two. One was a disappointment. Two is, unexpectedly, an even greater one.PS I think this had a rough ride in the edit suite. Keep an eye out for strange continuity and sound anomalies in the last hour. I reckon the first cut was well over 3 hours...",

It started a bit slow again. Seems like some of the events of the first hour should have been in part one but again we keep learning how Paul gets his legendary status and support.But the second part of the movie is glorious. We have so many great characters and development all over the place. The final battle is exciting, effects are awesome and soundtrack was on track.This is probably the great work of this generation and my kid was excited with the whole story and universe. I wish they would have given us some of the hints of what's coming but I'm happy on how it ended.I'm not loving Zendaya in this film. I feel her acting range is not suited for this one as she's the weaker cast in this film. Everyone else is very involved in their character but she's so plain and linear and doesn't match how great Timothée performs here.Can't wait for the next deliveries. I'm definitely going to see this movie several times as we need to support good movies when they appear. 10/10 and fully recommended.",

Maybe top 10 or higher movies of all time. So let's break down whyMusic: Hans Zimmer. Greatest of all time. The music that is portrayed through the film is just perfection. It's fantastic. It's tasty. It's impressive and it's filled with emotions. Every scene tells a tale and a story but with the music it becomes dreamy. Absolutely fantastic to see and feel and hear.Writing: This movie actually follows the books. I haven't personally read the books but many of my close friends has and they all say they are very pleased. From a neutral point of view, the lines, the way the movie and character was shown was fantastic. How certain words and lines, like Javier Bardem put out can fill your head with a much larger picture, is exactly what this movie needs. So well \"world building\". I am just deeply impressed. It wasn't too much comedy or jokes, but the perfect amount that got everyone in the cinema laughing, to people in the cinema crying and being impressed by the scenery.Visuals: Breathtaking. Fantastic. I don't have enough words. Some of the CGI (like 2 or 3 small parts) I found a bit odd but that's just movies for you. The visuals were fantastic. Denis is right. Some scenes you don't need words or lines to portray emotion or set the scene. Music and certain visuals will do it for you. Scary, Epic, Insane, Love. Everything was perfect. I am deeply impressed. Only movie recently with better visuals was Avatar 2 and that says A LOT!!!Characters: I don't want to make this way to long but wow. Timothy killed it. Javier killed it. Austin killed it. Zendaya killed it. Every actor killed it. Stellan was just PERFECT AGAIN!!! Scary as a ...... just fantastic man. So well done. Acting was perfect. Switching between emotions. I have just no words. This movie was just fantastic.Like I put on x, I rate this movie 8.8 out of time. Which is a high for me. I have very few films above 9 but this was one of those that was really close.",

I would even put Rebecca Ferguson's performance ahead of Timothée Chalamet. She was simply mesmerizing. There's not much more to say. Because everything is obvious. It's a perfect movie. Towards the end of the movie, my smart wristband gave me a pulse alert. Because the music of the movie affected me a lot. I think it is very lucky for the Oscar nominees that the movie was not released in 2023, otherwise Oppenheimer and the other nominees would have no chance against Dune.

Every scene is a payoff and not a single second is wasted as a filler. Denis uses the familiar troupes used in blockbusters and mixes it well with his own vision to deliver a product suitable for everyone.When modern blockbusters are afraid to be serious and fill themselves with pop culture references, it is is refreshing to see filmmakers push new boundaries in filmmaking. For a story set in a dystopian time period, it used the contemporary politics and existing feudalism in our societies to give us a compelling tale of faith and disbelief.",

But Villeneuve and his crew absolutely pulled it off again with this mesmerising masterpiece that pulled me down to the surface of Arrakis and pushed me through a religious revolution without ever letting go.That's not to deny its flaws. It's probably a bit too long. Some characters are turned into a caricature of themselves. Some deviations from the book were clearly done for brevity, but others are serious deviations that will surely have major ramifications as the story continues. It hits a little too hard on the nose with its core message that religion is a great power but morally ambiguous.All of that is nit-picking however. The film manages to combine multiple plot lines, character development and world building without sacrificing pace or relying on fight scenes to keep the momentum going. It's true to the broad strokes (and some of the smaller ones) of Frank Herbert's vision, but perfectly accessible to someone who only saw part one years ago. Every piece of the film making craft comes together in this beautiful sci-fi epic. For once, the cliche that watching a film in a cinema (with the largest screen you can get to) is an 'experience' rings true.",

    "Review Content": "Experiencing this sequel was a revelation, offering an immersion into a universe that rivals the depth and complexity of the most acclaimed fantasy series. The film's intricate world and narrative grandeur strongly suggest revisiting its predecessor, although its standalone prowess equally engages both longstanding fans and newcomers. Denis Villeneuve's directorial genius shines, making a compelling case for his stewardship over such epic narratives.Surpassing its prequel, the sequel boasts a mesmerizing score by Hans Zimmer, alongside unparalleled technical mastery in visual effects and cinematography, setting new benchmarks. The narrative weaves deeper character arcs while introducing captivating new figures, all amidst jaw-dropping action that leaves a lasting impression.This film not only concludes the journey begun earlier but also skillfully lays the groundwork for future explorations in this saga. Anticipation for its sequel, \"Dune: Messiah,\" is high, with hopes it will further elevate the genre in upcoming awards seasons, challenging prevailing biases against fantasy/sci-fi narratives.An IMAX viewing is recommended to fully appreciate this cinematic masterpiece, poised to become a genre-defining classic. This sequel comes highly recommended, promising an unforgettable cinematic experience.",

I now just can't wait for Dune 3!!! The trailers don't do this film justice, and I love that there is consistent action... you will be amazed by both the start of the film and the ending... You really do need a big imax experience with a huge screen to enjoy, as the cinema I was in was abit loud... best to say I will 100% be watching this again and a massive well done the whole entire cast, after my disappointment with films over the past few years.. this has breathed life back into it.

I don't want it to be another dark knight because I want Dune 3 to ascend even beyond this but the bar is set just too high.Through the movie characters are given more depth, new ones are introduced there motivations are shown, and yet we cannot simply say who to root for. All characters have their own sets of dynamics and even the simplest of lines in part 1 are given a grand entry in part 2. The visionary director once again succeeded in providing some new breathtaking visuals and too see Hans Zimmer give another great musical is just the cherry on top you need.Overall it's a great movie and a great successor to Dune 1. The scale is set too high but I know the director will have something new waiting for us in part 3 as well.",

I will be thinking about this movie for days, and will watch it again several more times. The last time a movie blew my mind like this was when the first Avatar came out in theaters, or the Dark Knight, or Braveheart. This movie ranks at the top of the list of the best movies of all time. The sound track by Hans Zimmerman is also amazing. It really moves your heart and emotions while watching the film. I've ordered the book now and can't wait to read it. Go see this movie in theaters before its digital release. You'll be glad you did.",

Everything about this film is so very well done.I'm a big fan of the book and was curious as to how they were going to tackle or introduce some of the things that happen.I felt like what was delivered in Dune: Part Two was the best adaptation they could have made.There are changes, for sure. But a book like Dune, written the way it was written (with lots of perspective and inner monologue) was never going to 100% translate to the big screen. It's tricky adapting books at the best of times.The limited time a film has to tell a story like Dune also would have led to some of the changes in plot and character development.Overall I think it kept the ideas and themes of the book while telling an incredibly similar, fantastic story with incredible visuals and insane score.10/10 for sure.",

If you haven't seen it you must go see it.This was a perfect sequel to Denis' part one. It accomplished all the main plot points of the book while delivering stellar performances and visuals that most films only dream of having.I'm excited for dune 3 now and will be looking forward to that as well....",

    "Review Date": "2024-02-29",
    "Review Content": "Rating: 9.4\nOverall, a technical masterpiece that is led by Villeneuve's vision and groundbreaking technicals because this film sets a new benchmark in cinema as it builds on the trend in making large-scale, IMAX movies an event, but the film is held back from being perfect by its fast pace and too short runtime as you are left wanting more.Incredible Direction (The film is brilliant on a macroscale as it provides something more epic than the first, with its vast dunes, gigantic crowds, and colossal battle scenes; the direction on a microscale is great because it is less Sci-fi/formulaic this time as the scenes touch on more messiah/prophecy-like meanings and how this power leads to corruption; the direction of actors is better this time as you really see every performance get elevated as each actor truly feels like they are serving their purpose; the storytelling has tones to both sci-fi epics as well as messiah/prophecy-like stories, and Villeneuve tells these tones on a grand scale; Villeneuve builds tension very well as he uses sound, action, scale, and story to showcase how epic this sequel is, building on everything the first film established), Good to Very Good Acting (Very Good from Timothée Chalamet (For the first half of the movie, it was hard to believe him as Paul Atredies, but after one scene, there is a full 180-degree switch where he fully immerses himself as the Lisan al Gaib and carries the movie to the finish line), Good to Very Good from Zendaya (Plays an integral part in buttressing Chalamet's performance in becoming one with the Freman, and does so by establishing good chemistry between the two; in her solo moments, she shows off in portraying her disbelief in the messiah as she as her character is more of a realist), Very Good from Rebecca Ferguson (Has both motherly and antagonistic characteristics throughout the movie as her character is someone who can simultaneously help and hurt the protagonist, and by the end, she fully immerses herself in her role), Good to Very Good from Josh Brolin (Plays a fatherly figure to Chalamet 's character well and still shows how he is a loyal solider to the House of Atreides), Good to Very Good from Austin Butler (Really embodies that his character is the heir to the Harkonnen throne as he does a good job at being a sociopathic antagonist), Good from Florence Pugh (Really isn't given that much to work with but does a good job at being a central figure in her scenes), Pretty Good from Dave Bautista (Shows status in a lot of his scenes, but he is very over-the-top in a lot of moments, and he isn't given much to work with by the time the climax arrives), Good from Christopher Walken (Literally just plays Christopher Walken), Pretty Good from Léa Seydoux (She's in the movie for like 2 scenes), Good to Very Good from Stellan Skarsgård (Carries over where he left off in the last film as he does a good job in showing the greed of the House of Harkonnen), Very Good to Great from Javier Bardem (The best performance in the movie as you really believe that he is a believer in the Lisan al Gaib prophecy and will do everything he can to help Paul achieve that potential, filling the void Duncan, Leto, and Gurney left in the first film; shows a wide range of emotions and can seamlessly transition from humorous to anger to infatuated in a second), Pretty Good to Good from the rest of the cast (Everyone does their job as you can see different sides of the spectrum on the belief of Paul as the Lisan al Gaib/Heir to the Atredies throne)), Very Good to Great Story (The concept carries out the intended purpose of the second half of the book as it follows Paul's journey in becoming the Lisan al Gaib (and does so in a way that mixes Sci-Fi elements with religious elements), and the film stays pretty true to the source material and only deviates to better fit the narrative that Villeneuve crafted; the plot structure is great for the most part as the movie itself has its own plot, but also benefits from having there be little needed exposition as that was the intent of the first film (this film picks up right where it's predecessor left off); the main issue with the plot structure/runtime is that the film felt too short as 20-30 minutes could have been added to help slow scenes down and show how epic this movie is (especially in the climax as it feels shorter than it needed to be); flow between sequences is very good as each sequence feels connected to the last (though these sequences could have been slowed down to emphasize the sequence's importance to the story); the character writing is great as you see the impact the conflict has on the characters and how they react (with character's blindly following this prophecy and some even being corrupted by it by taking advantage of this new found power)), Great Screenplay (The dialogue is a lot more polished this time around as it sounds less Sci-Fi heavy and more realistic; the humor is used well throughout the movie (and this is mainly from Stilgar/Javier Bardem's character); the symbolism is incredibly profound as you can see the metaphors to Biblical/Prophecy-like Messiahs aiming to free people, and this movie goes one step further by showing how this power can lead to corruption and losing morals; the foreshadowing is executed well as it helps show this concept of the corruption of power as Paul is scared to be the Lisan al Gaib because of what it might do to his morals, and this also shows the relationship Paul will have with the Freman and the other houses), Great Score (Used very well to build the world and used more to build tension than last time, but it just feels like he reused a lot of the same themes as last time), Brilliant Cinematography (A technical benchmark as the movie is shot entirely in the IMAX, and they use this effectively as it helps show how grand of an epic this movie is, especially in the large crowd scenes and the colossal battles; the coloring/lighting they used in many of the scenes were stunning and rival some of the shots from Blade Runner 2049 (especially in the Gladiator scene and the final fight)), Incredible Sound (Does an amazing job in setting the tone, showing how grand this epic is, and displaying the weight power has on followers (especially from Paul's perspective)), Incredible Editing (Carries off where the previous film left off as it helps show how so many small pieces come together to make this grand epic; Used effectively well in the interpersonal scenes to show how the visions of grandeur affect the characters), Incredible Visual Effects (Helps show how grand the epic is and is seamlessly used amongst the real world, making it feel like you are transported to Arrakis), Great to Incredible Production Design (Continues where it left off as it helps portray the vastness of Arrakis and how grand this movie is with its sets and design; pulls a lot from Ancient Middle Eastern/Egyptian culture to show the beliefs of the characters and how they are waiting for the Lisan al Gaib to save them), Great Makeup (Improves from the last film in helping showcase traditional Sci-Fi elements (like with the blue eyes and the Harkonnen), but feels even more polished this time), Very Good Costumes (Continued where it left off last time), Pacing is a bit too fast as the movie breezes through its runtime by going through as much plot as it can, and this leaves you wanting more because it does not give you enough time to sit with what was going on (I would have liked 20-30 minutes to help slow the pace down), Climax is incredibly grand and the best part of the movie as the whole final hour of the movie feels like everything was clicking as we got to see how grand this epic was with its large-scale fights and sets, but it feels a bit too short and could've benefited from a longer runtime to elongate come of the abrupt fight scenes, Tone is more biblical in nature this time around as you saw the impact the prophecy of the Lisan al Gaib had on the characters, but there are still many scenes where it still has Sci-Fi tones, This movie improved on almost every aspect from the previous film and is setting the groundwork for 'Dune: Messiah' to be even more grand and epic, but even if this was the last movie, I would have been satisfied where they left the movie off; the film being shot in IMAX truly is an achievement in itself and will set the trend for more films to follow; With Oppenheimer, this movie is now making going to the movies in IMAX a true spectacle (as if you were going to a concert)",

    "Review Content": "This movie is just fun to watch. All the details give the fremen a soul.Yes, it left some stuff from the book out, but it also added things.You can see the true nature of the fremen apart from fierce fighting. Female characters like Lady Jessica and Chani gain importance which they really deserve. Due to the movies rather slow pace you can really feel how Fremen Fanatics draw Paul out to be their Messiah and through Chani and Paul you can see that they initially don't need a white male savior, because they are strong themselves.Outside of Arrakis however you see how much Paul Muad D'ib is underestimated. They already try to find another puppet for their game: Feyd Rautha. A total mad man who really shows his sardistic side.The movie is an homage to the books. Each actor portrayals their role beautifully so that they feel really like their character.The cinematography obviously is a special touch; a feeling of amazement and passion for Arrakis.The score only adds to that; makes you feel the world.In my eyes it is perfect to understand and just cool.Avoiding the difficulties in portraying Alia by just postponing her birth. Cutting the space guild, cutting Hawat Turfirs little Arc or the intrigues of The Baron and the Na-Baron. All of these things gave more space to the fremen. And that REALLY paid out.",

    "Review Title": "Dune 2: A Masterpiece of Sci-Fi Cinema",
    "Review Date": "2024-03-01",
    "Review Content": "Dune 2 is a stunning sequel that delivers on the promise of the first part and takes the epic sci-fi saga to new heights. Director Denis Villeneuve has crafted a visually spectacular and emotionally gripping film that explores the themes of destiny, power, and resistance in a complex and fascinating universe.The film picks up where the first one left off, with Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) joining the Fremen, the native people of the desert planet Arrakis, who are fighting against the brutal rule of the Harkonnen family. Paul is seen by some Fremen as their prophesied messiah, the Kwisatz Haderach, who will lead them to freedom and glory. However, Paul is also haunted by visions of a bloody future that he may not be able to avoid.Dune 2 expands the scope and scale of the story, introducing new characters and locations that enrich the world-building and the plot. We meet the mysterious Bene Gesserit sisterhood, the powerful Emperor Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken), the cunning Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen (Austin Butler), and the fierce Fremen warrior Chani (Zendaya), who becomes Paul's love interest. We also travel to different planets, such as the water-rich Caladan, the industrial Giedi Prime, and the imperial Kaitain.The film is a feast for the eyes and ears, with stunning cinematography, production design, costumes, and special effects. The desert landscapes of Arrakis are breathtaking, the sandworms are awe-inspiring, and the space battles are thrilling. The film also boasts a phenomenal score by Hans Zimmer, who creates a haunting and immersive soundscape that blends orchestral, electronic, and ethnic elements. The film is best experienced in IMAX, where the sound and the visuals are amplified to create a truly immersive experience.The film also features excellent performances from the cast, who bring depth and nuance to their roles. Chalamet is superb as Paul, portraying his inner conflict and his growing charisma and confidence. Ferguson is equally impressive as Jessica, who balances her maternal instincts and her loyalty to the Bene Gesserit. Zendaya is captivating as Chani, who shares a strong chemistry with Chalamet and adds a touch of romance to the film. Bardem, Skarsgård, Bautista, and Butler are also memorable as the Fremen leader Stilgar, the grotesque Baron Harkonnen, the savage Beast Rabban, and the sinister Feyd-Rautha, respectively.Dune 2 is not a film that tries to please everyone. It is faithful to the source material by Frank Herbert, which means that it is complex, dense, and challenging. It does not shy away from the dark and violent aspects of the story, nor does it simplify the political and religious implications. It also does not offer a conventional or satisfying conclusion, as it is only the second part of a planned trilogy. However, for those who appreciate the vision and ambition of Villeneuve and Herbert, Dune 2 is a masterpiece that deserves to be seen on the big screen.",

The character development in just this one movie is outstanding and the actors all excell. I wish they could get an Oscar each. It's a well thought through movie with only minor rushed moments. But at the same time, I am grateful that the screentime wasn't wasted on fight scenes but rather focused on conversations and non verbal communication between the characters. I can highly recommend this movie to anyone. Even to those who usually don't like sci-fi. It's a must see, iconic movie.",

Treat yourself.Dune is such an enthralling story, in it's own right, it deserves to be transferred into the two films that it now occupies. Jodorosky had his go, Lynch had his go and now Villeneuve has produced these 2 gems. I hope other film makers are paying attention. There's so much tosh being produced at the moment but Dune has re-kindled my belief that there are still great moments to be had in film making.Long live the fighters.",

Directing, cinematography, acting, music, editing, effects-everything was very good and worked meticulously. It seems that great importance was given to the sound editing of the film. Hans Zimmer wasn't bad, though. I don't like Timothée Chalamet very much in terms of acting, but he was very good in this movie. Everyone was very good. In fact, Zendaya was the weakest among them.

While there are divergencies from the books, it thematically follows and still captures the heart of the corruption of power, religion, ecological transformation, ethics, war and violence that Frank Herbert played on in his masterpiece. The multiple shots, sometimes only a few seconds, that paid tribute to conversations and interplay within the books was excellent. I wish they had had time to include the full story given how beautifully choregraphed each scene is, but its already almost 3 hours and somethings just have to be cut.It impressively does all this while still spending enough time on character building and capturing the \"plan within a plan within a plan.\" Just well done, I hope there will be an extended trilogy cut in the future.

Don't forget, I want the highest appreciation to the party responsible for the CGI. It's been a long time since I've seen a film with subtle CGI like this.

I've rarely left the theater feeling so much enjoyment. It's a must see in IMAX.I started as a skeptic of the whole Dune universe but now it's one of my all time favorites. Would highly recommend this movie. Go see it!",

    "Review Date": "2024-03-05",
    "Review Content": "Dune 2 proved to be a sublime continuation of the captivating narrative that left me hanging after the first installment. The storytelling in this sequel reached new heights, seamlessly weaving complex characters, political intrigue, and profound conflicts. Each plot twist was meticulously crafted, keeping me enthralled and engaged from start to finish. The film delved deeper into the intricacies of the Dune universe, delivering a rich and immersive experience that truly satisfied the cravings of fans eagerly awaiting more from Frank Herbert's masterpiece.What truly set Dune 2 apart, however, was its visual spectacle. The film showcased breathtaking landscapes of Arrakis and introduced intricately designed sandworms that were nothing short of awe-inspiring. The meticulous attention to detail, combined with cutting-edge cinematography, brought the Dune world to life in ways that exceeded my expectations. The visual prowess of the movie, particularly during the exhilarating scenes where the Fremen and House Atreides orchestrated a meticulously coordinated assault, unleashing a symphony of destruction from every conceivable angle. This almost compelled me to rise from my seat in sheer excitement. Dune 2 not only met but surpassed expectations, setting an exceptionally high standard for the future of the franchise.",

    "Review Content": "I imagine there's a line around the block of actors wanting to work with Denis Villeneuve. His body of work is very strong and Dune: Part Two is another great addition. It was visually outstanding with stunning techinical achievements from the production design to the sound mixing and effects. Much like the first outing, Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya head up a very impressive cast. I enjoyed Austin Butler's supporting role as a menacing antagonist, a shame his screen time was limited. I have to laugh a bit at Charlotte Rampling who plays a Reverend Mother, although it's hard to see her face under her dark costume. I guess anybody could have played that role but it does show the filmmakers effort to cast a great actress like Rampling, just hard to see her performance. I think at just shy of 3 hours the story was a tad drawn out for my liking. I admit to be a fan of a complete story although I do appreciate there's more to tell.I would have preferred a full story resolution but it will be exciting to visit this cinematic 'Dune-iverse' in the near future.",

I can not say if it followed the book closer than the 1984 version, however I can tell you that the 1984 version is better in every way. This version does not have the interplay between the characters that the original had and the love story between Paul and Chani is very poorly done. The fight sequences are not as well carried out and the second installment did not flow well with the first version. I understand that a third version will be produced, I can only hope that a better job is done on that one. I for one will be in no hurry to watch it after this installment.",

The part that bothered me most is that Chani went into the dessert when kn the book Paul took the princess but, made it clear that Chani was his mate and the he would never give Irulan a child and he would not follow the bene gesseritt's plans to control the bloodlines throughout the ages.",

These changes not only helped make the story more coherent to a casual audience, but also highlighted some character motives without having to dive too deep into other plotlines.For those were just looking to see a well-made piece of cinema, you will not be disappointed. It's a visually stunning, emotionally, gripping, and well crafted cautionary tale on charismatic leaders.Denis Villeneuve take a bow.

    "Review Date": "2024-03-02",
    "Review Content": "I think the set designs, costumes and the cast were far better in the 1984 version then the new version. The bearing of the actors in the old version really did feel like a royal lineage, the new Paul Atreides feels like a surfer dude and doesn't have the bearing and feel of a royal prince ( Kyle MacLachlan did a fantastic job and is far superior to Chalamet.)The same goes for all the other actors of the original apart from Rabban ( Bautista's version does give off a very impressive malevolent air).The new version ( although having better CGI, sound design and cinematography) lacks the intricacy, depth and overall feeling of the far superior older movie. It also lacks that mystical feeling that the old one had. The new version feels in a sense, very soulless and slipshod, from the costumes to the set designs ( Villeneuve loves to do these very minimalistic looks to his sets which don't look convincing at all.)Compare the Emperor Shaddams royal throne room in the old movie to the new movie, the old version so otherworldly, intricate and marvelous to look at. The new version looks like it was knocked up in half a day, embarrassingly bland and uninspiring. The same goes for all the costumes from the Bennie Gesserit to The Harkonnens, the old version felt like they really put a lot of thought, effort and soul into each and every piece, the new versions felt simplistic, flat and souless.Even the still suits in the new version look far inferior to the old ones ( the older version looked neat, compact and elegant, the new version look like a patchwork of rubber).It's like Alerando Jodorowsky said:It's very well done,\" Jodorowsky said. \"We can see that it is industrial cinema, that there is a lot of money, and that it was very expensive. But if it was very expensive, it must pay in proportion. And that is the problem: There are no surprises. The form is identical to what is done everywhere. The shape of it, the lighting, the acting, it's all predictable.",

    "Review Content": "Spurred on by revenge as Paul embraces Fremen ways, he must battle against all odds while wrangling with a Fremen prophecy that could change Arrakis and its people forever.Director Denis Villeneuve's meticulous attention to detail and his ability to balance grand spectacle with intimate character moments elevate the adaptation of Frank Herbert's work to new heights. Although Dune didn't stand on its own, thankfully, the studio greenlit Dune Part Two. It's an epic continuation that masterfully explores the intricate dynamics of power, destiny, and familial bonds.Interestingly, Timothy Chalamet's portrayal of Paul Atreides echoes at times Oscar Isaac's depiction of Duke Leto Atreides, making you buy into their father-son relationship. Chalamet gives a powerful performance, conveying the weight of his responsibilities, drawing viewers deeper into the rich tapestry of the Dune universe.Along with the score, the visual effects make it an immersive experience, from the vast landscapes of Arrakis to the intricate designs of the sandworms. Oozing screen presence, leads Stellan Skarsgård, Dave Bautista, and Austin Butler add a genuine sense of danger. Along with Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin, and Charlotte Rampling, Javier Bardem's compelling performance as Stilgar adds depth to the ensemble cast. As well as the supporting cast leads Léa Seydoux, Florence Pugh, and Christopher Walken are notable. Also, it was nice to see Babs Olusanmokun 'fittingly' return as Jamis even if briefly. Jason Momoa and Stephen McKinley Henderson are missed even if their absence is expected.Overall, with its gripping storyline, stellar performances, and stunning visuals, Villeneuve's offering solidifies itself as a great piece of science fiction cinema, but like the first Dune, it leaves viewers eagerly anticipating the next chapter.",

There was too much riding on her acting skills and she just couldn't do it. They could have gone with so many other actresses but they didn't. Whenever she was on the screen, I just wanted her to go away. She isn't likable. She only has one tone to her acting. She just seems annoyed. I think that's why I liked the first one more.

The director leveraged contemporary cinematic techniques in an attempt to mask his incapacity to translate such an ambitious project onto the screen. He not only altered but effectively eviscerated the narrative, disregarding the nuanced dialogues meticulously crafted by Frank Herbert, thus undermining the integrity of what promised to be a remarkable film. The performances still fall short of expectations. It was particularly disheartening to witness the transformation of the face of Paul, a character of profound strength in the novel, into one of palpable dread during his confrontation with Feyd-Rautha. The director has distorted or entirely omitted sections of the narrative that were critical and intriguing, rendering the film a mere shadow of the book's rich tapestry. It is a lamentable outcome.",

This movie easily crosses that bar and puts it even higher above. It's a masterclass of film making with a visual and accoustic experience that will leave you delighted to your core. Every shot is grand, larger-than-life film making, and certainly shows every little dime of its budget, as does its set design, costumes, make-up, effect work, sound, and the INCREDIBLE score by Hans Zimmer. An epic piece of cinema we haven't seen since the Lord of the Rings movies over 20 years ago.It wouldn't work though without an fitting cast. Timothée Chalamet delivers a presence I didn't think was possible. Zendaya does a lot of heavy lifting, while Javier Bardem mixes his amazing role as the true believer Stilgar with some subtle bits of humour. Austin Butler's Feyd-Rautha is a terrifying psychopath you enjoy hating while he's on screen.I may see this again soon, but what I really need is more. Hopefully we can get more \"Dune\" movies from the same team and cast in the coming years.",

    "Review Content": "Beyond expectations. Masterclass in storytelling and cinema. This is why we go to the movies. From the gorgeous cinematography instantly iconic in each scene to the rib breaking score by Hans Zimmer, the knee deep flood of A-list actors peppering the screen bringing every ounce of talent, this movie hits like Dark Knight, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, and Infinity War.My only grief (if I'd even call it that) is that even at 2 hours and 46 minutes this movie flies by. It's clear that a little exposition has been cut and I'm sure there's an extended cut waiting for home release as is standard for WB and Legendary. And you can tell by the brisk pacing that they needed to fit in Dune's larger world building by trimming a little fat. But for those who felt like Part I was slow, this is THE roller coaster ride. From start to finish.The conflict rages on as Paul (Timothy Chalamet) cements his position with the Fremen to gain control back for the planet Arrakis from the Harkkonians. Mentored by a budding love interest with a fierce Fremen warrior, Chani (the ever popular Zenaya), and further mentored by a senior believer Stilgar (Javier Bardem), Paul starts feeling inner conflicts of being heralded as a prophesied savior or a blasphemous interloper. Compounding the conflict is Paul's mother (Rebecca Ferguson) who has secrets to be revealed, the Harkkonians responsible for destroying House Attreides building their forces, and the emperor's decreasing grasp on Spice production. I cannot say anymore than that because it'll start spoiling the movie.Far and away my favorite scene is Paul's baptism by fire with Arrakis' native megafauna. Anybody familiar with the story knows what I mean, but it is one of those moments that you never forget. Like Arnold Schwarzenegger being pursued by a semi in the LA canal, Paul's Fremen trial will define the series.I know reviewers have already posted this, but this is this decade's Empire Strikes Back. One to own and definitely not to be missed.",

Yes, somebody wrote that. After watching Dune: Part Two I can tell you, that this is definitely NOT the Empire Strikes Back of our generation. It has neither a plot twist like Empire and the good guys don't lose, instead they win pretty easily. So if you compare these two movies with another the only comman ground you will find is that both are the secon parts of their trilogies and that they are both sci-fi movies. That's the end of the tale.So let's talk about the movie. I liked Dune Part aone because of the visuals and the soundtrack. The story was solid and entertaining but it didn't hook me that much. Also the characters are a bit too flat. If you look at the IMDb rating (8.0) you see that the general audience liked it but it is no masterpiece.So my expectations for the second part were not that high and so they got surpassed, because this time the story got me. It just happened more and it felt like more action than in the first part. The visuals got even better, just take the black and white parts and Hans Zimmer's score is amazing again. The battle in the end was also satisfying and so this movie turns out be a pretty outstanding one.And this is the time I have to return to my opening part, because unfortunately some people of our generation z have to make some stupid statements they know nothing about. Don't get me wrong, everybody has the right to rate this film like he wants. The problem I have is with those people saying things that are not true like comparing it with Empire Strikes Back or even Lord of the Rings.If you had watched these movies you would know that they are not just better, but also completely different.

The world of the \"master\" turned out to be sand-empty, the characters seem completely lifeless to me, the dialogues are emotionless, deliberately pretentious, I don't see much sense in them, they are absolutely not interesting to listen to, and they only confirm the shortcomings of the work. I would characterize the painting as minimalism in the void - a reflection of the inner world.Fiction is one of the most difficult and expensive genres, and Frank Herbert's novel is a real masterpiece that requires special attention.And I am well aware that to bring such a work to the screen is a huge work and beyond everyone's power, and the setting and ENT itself are tricky to perform and contain many \"pitfalls\"Villeneuve's vision and style, in my opinion, somewhat damaged the original source. The book text has been shortened and changed, which in turn affects the meaning of the story, conversations between the characters (oriental-style gibberish) seem like childish \"gibberish\", which makes them ridiculous and annoying without any benefit. It seems to me that the picture is not fully completed, the events are too compressed and leave many unanswered questions. The role of Christopher Walken in the film turned out to be quite poor and insignificant, he simply had nothing to play, and the antiheroes remained underdeveloped, unsaid, and even the most important \"villain\" faded from the narrative, Villeneuve could not come up with any intelligible arch for him, this once again shows the shortcomings of the creator, it is difficult for him to give personalities, but it is easy - images. The visual part of the work overshadowed the drama, leaving a feeling of fading and emptiness. To fully understand and analyze this picture, I will have to revise it, although I absolutely do not want to do this, because the visual style of the director in this picture turned out to be a common method that offers nothing but minimalism, contains neither meaning nor emotions, but only small images on a large empty canvas.I will conclude my lengthy discussion with the words of Leonardo da Vinci: \"Where the spirit does not lead the artist's hand, there is no art...",

I can't wait to see it again, and I eagerly await new of the filming of Messiah. But I first I guess I better read it!",

    "Review Content": "SPOILERS\nI'll try to keep my review short and on point.Villeneuve sure knows how to shoot a film; I'll give him that. Part 2 is as equally absurdly beautiful as Part 1. The acting is on par with the first film, which suffices.My critique of the first film follows along with Part 2 in that I wanted this series to follow more closer to the book and the films that have come before. Major characters and plot points have been totally removed.Denis spends 3 minutes showing the audience some mundane item like a wall mural, or these sweeping images of the desert and moon; while characters and their motivations get pushed to the way side. Actors' kind of just show up, spit out a few lines of dialogue and then DISAPPEAR. The Baron (highlight of the first film for me) is barely in part 2. Thufir Hywat has been completely removed from the film, so we never see his fate. New characters with the excpetion of Feyd are introduced but serve very little to drive the story along. The entire storyline has been compressed from YEARS down to what I can determine to be only a few months on Arrakis. Alia is an imaginary character who speaks through Jessica. The Spacing Guild is never mentioned or seen in part 2. Gurney reappears and his whole suspicion of Jessica being the spy that betrayed House Atreides that night has been removed.There's just so much MISSING from these films that it begs consideration if Warner Bros/HBO shouldn't just have made Dune a series to do the story justice.With all of that said, did I enjoy Part 2? YES! Would I suggest seeing it in IMAX theaters? Well, only if that's your thing. The movie is about 2hrs and 36 minutes long. I was on the verge of feeling bored but the film picks back up just as that feeling starts to creep in. There are 3 action sequences that are 100% worth the ticket price alone, it's just that those scenes are surrounded by beautiful cinematography of mountain ranges, sand dunes, pools of water, and trivial dialogue deliveries from the star studded cast for that 2.5 hours.",

    "Review Title": "Denis Villeneuve's Sci-Fi Epic Is Gigantic, Incredible & A Modern Cinematic Achievement",
    "Review Date": "2024-02-28",
    "Review Content": "Dune 2 (2024) :\nMovie Review -Dune 2 Review : First of all, let's hail the great Denis Villeneuve for getting one of the greatest casting coups on board for Dune 2 with Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin, Austin Butler, Florence Pugh, Dave Bautista, Christopher Walken, Léa Seydoux, Stellan Skarsgård, Charlotte Rampling, and Javier Bardem. Secondly, let's hail the genius filmmaker for his extraordinary vision that he has kept hidden for years. He was so busy with story-driven films, so we all thought that he couldn't make a big-screen spectacle like Cameron or Jackson. Dune 2 proves that he has enough fire to light the big screen with his astonishing direction skills and visionary storytelling. Dune 2 surpasses the grandeur of Dune Part 1, or, for that matter, any Hollywood movie in recent times, except Avatar: The Way Water. The said Pandora's Blue Tale lacked a unique story, but Denis got it here for his dusty desert tale. So it's like it's a visual spectacle meeting a tremendously rich script. You can't afford to miss that, can you?Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) is accepted in the Fremen tribe and is trying to be one of them. While he is getting better during the trailer, Stilgar (Javier Bardem) informs Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) that their Reverend Mother is dying, convincing her to become a replacement by drinking the Water of Life, a deadly poison that is fatal to males and the untrained. She drinks it and turns herself into a mother Reverend, but because she is pregnant, it might turn ill on her. She starts speaking to her unborn child, a daughter, who keeps guiding her on what to do next. Meanwhile, Paul embraces the Fremen ways and learns their language, passing tests like riding a sandworm. He begins a romantic relationship with Chani, becomes a Fedaykin fighter, and assists during raids on Harkonnen spice harvesters, earning the mantles \"Muad'Dib\" and \"Usul,\" by which the Fremen identify him as the \"man who leads the path.\" On the other hand, Baron (Stellan Skarsgård) demotes Rabbani (Bautista) for humiliating the family by running away from the fight and makes psychotic Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler) a new leader. Paul Muad'Dib leads the troop to the south and is joined by the former military leader of Atreides, Gurney (Josh Brolin). Will Paul be able to defeat Baron and Feyd-Rautha?Dune 2 is an engrossing script that lasts for 160 minutes without becoming dull. Yes, there are a few moments that feel slow, but nothing too serious. The conversations are engaging, and some comedy scenes also work despite repetitive lines. Dune 2 scores high in visual presentation. It's an alien world with human-like characters, but it's completely out of your imagination. That's the power of the sci-fi epic genre, right? You must create a world that hasn't been seen or imagined by others. Only then can you convince viewers to believe in your vision and fantasy world. Every single feature of Dune 2 is a prime example of a creative sci-fi world. You get to see new kinds of clothes, people, soldiers, weapons, gods, spiritual idols, wars, and what not. The desert, storm, attacks, machines, flying machines, and what not-how on earth did Denis visualise all these alien things? And the bigger question is, how did he bring them alive on screen without any compromise? That's the most stunning part of Dune 2, and that's more than enough reason why you should not miss this larger-than-life spectacle on the big screen.Dune 2 has a solid acting unit. Timothée Chalamet may have just gotten the role of a lifetime, and how bleeding good he is as Paul Muad'Dib Usul! You get to see a wonderful transformation from him, and he is likely to take it to a whole new level in the upcoming Dune movies. Zendaya has given a great performance despite many limits to her character. Rebecca Ferguson will stun you with her deadly role in this one. Let me warn you, she is not the same Rebecca/Jessica you saw in Dune Part 1. So, be prepared for a surprise. Austin Butler fits well as a new antagonist, but I think he should have had more scenes. Josh Brolin and Dave Bautista were good in their roles, while the female side was well managed by Florence Pugh and Léa Seydoux. Christopher Walken and Stellen Skarsgard get some important scenes, and they show what experienced actors can do. Charlotte Rampling hardly shows her face, so I couldn't catch any expressions, but the voice tone was nice. Javier Bardem will go down as one of the best characters from Dune 2 for his involvement as a character and its growth as well. All those comic punches were hit by him only.Dune 2 has eye-pleasing cinematography (Greig Fraser) and a terrific background score by maestro Hans Zimmer. Joe Walker's editing keeps you on the edge of your seat despite the long runtime. I used to say that a long runtime doesn't hurt if it's Avatar 2 and Oppenheimer. Now, I'll add Dune 2 to that sentence. Keeping audiences interested in your story for 160 minutes is a big task nowadays. Dune 2 passes that litmus test too. Now, come to the captain of the ship, the master, the great Denis Villeneuve. I have been a huge fan of Incendies (2010), and I always believed that Villeneuve was better with such pathbreaking stories and thrillers, not grandeurs. Well, he proved me wrong, and I am so happy. Dune 2 comes as a testament that Denis can handle big-ticket entertainers too without hurting his content-loving fanbase. You may be a Marvel or a DC fan for their explosive entertainers, but the real \"Marvel of a cinema\" is here. Dune 2 has some outstanding war scenes that come with incredible vision and fantastic storytelling by the master filmmaker. In short, it's like Cameron meets Scorsese! I said it there, and I am so proud to say it. Overall, Dune 2 is stunning, incredible, wonderful, and anything close to whatever you call a modern-age sci-fi classic. Do yourself a favour and watch it in IMAX. The experience will shake you.RATING - 7.5/10*",

    "Review Content": "One of the best cinema experiences I've ever had, watched it three times back to back within 3 days so I can say this with my personal, utmost bias and clear thoughts.A direct continuation from Part 1, which is absolutely recommended and required to watch. Following Paul's house being destroyed and being forced to take cover with the Fremen, it follows Paul's insertion and ascension to the Prophet mentioned and how he engrains himself into the Fremen culture and move pieces across the galaxy board.Story wise, impeccable. Every scene adds something enriching from connecting characters to progressing themes or plots or adding or introducing characters. Dennis nailed and refined the script to make every scene captivating. It also includes some of the best sci-fi visuals I've ever seen, the home world of the Harkonens with the black sun leading to the rest of the people having white skin was incredible awe-inspiring. Paul's personal growth was incredible, from becoming a Fremen via various tasks like riding a sand worm to the immediate switch when he drank the Water of Life switching the pacing to another height entirely. Incredible growth from major characters especially Paul's mother and Chani besides Paul whilst also expanding among other large characters in the Dune universe such as the Emporer and the Na-Baron Feyd, the Baron's nephew.Acting, A+ from literally everyone across the board. Not one lacking, everyone brought their utmost to every role, no matter how minor and it's incredible to see considering how many big actors are in the roles.The cinematography and visuals were on another level this movie, I would highly recommend IMAX, anything else would reduce the movie's quality. The cinematographer did their best work ever with many of the shots and scenes becoming iconic already; concise and clear, never wobbly with the greatest visuals imagery in any sci-fi movie.Sound design also impeccable, honestly this may be considered the best aspect from the movie perspective. Every boom, bass, just completely gripped you into the world, helps it stand out and be remembered long after the movie has ended.TL;DR: best in literally aspect a movie could be, worth many rewatches and in IMAX. A mighty achievement of a sci-fi movie and just any movie generally and will become an all-time classic. Dennis Villeneuve once again proves he's one of the best directors working today and my personal favourite.",

Now.part two is here n is way i expected as one to watch for this year.The movie stay true to the book n reinvented it it ways that director Denis Villeneuve is the master of neo sci fi. The story telling is well crafted for a three hour film how he balances from the guerrilla warfare on Arrakis to introducing new characters that will play a pivotal role.Like the relationship of Timothee Chalamet n Zedaya how they matter ones to the other, facing every trial along the way from battling the Hawkkonen to not going where the fundamental live south, n that's where everything goes down hill i love how Zedaya Chani rejects the idea of Paul drinking the water of life n change him into another person who interests in starting a war then spending hes life with her.Timothee shiny very awesomely in playing Paul trying to prove to the freeman to hes vision of the dangers have if he goes south, when he messiah mode thats the worst come out n is great from the secret thats he Hawkornen to not caring what Chani thinks of him now. Is absolutely brilliant in character development.Rebecca Ferguson as the new reverend mother was scary but well David Lynch type she spend the whole film talking to her unborn child n to me that was beautiful bizarre cause shows her dark side of the belief that the freeman has to Paul.Josh Brolin plays well as Josh Brolin, Stellan Skarsgard love every moment as Baron indulging himself went he how take command on Arrakis, but villainy acting proves that he can make control everything.Manipulated, cinical, omen forcefully oh yeah she was mean, Javier Bandem play a well freeman believer from been obsessive to the prophecy to showing Paul the ropes for sandworm surfing's. But the one that made good impression got to go to the socialpath of Feyf-Rautina from he's debut on the glatorial in the Hawkonnen home planet, to taking charge of the freeman attacks, ending it with knife due with Paul Mua Di, this villain that define today's sci fi madmen but more psichotic.My goodness the the sound track was extra comical, making sound of fate to the torment of war. But best when belief becomes fanaticism n soundtrack prove that's. N then ye got the cinematography by Greg Fraser love the wind blowing the dunes the mountains of the freeman, to the toxically world of the Hawkonnen to the emperor phere ship entering Arrakis, n the spice homebased. Villeneuve vision of this world was magnificent inspire by true events like the prophecy of freeman is something coming's from the Muslim belief, to also their attention to their own art of war, where fanaticism can take a whole group of believers.So to conclude is epic this is the version that we ve waiting for since Frank Herberg publish it, n it doesn't bored for the three hours that run, there's more to see from this world n the many houses that depend on spice production, it hasn't been confirm that Villeneuve will direct messiah, chances re is gonna happen.By then i better read it.",

    "Review Content": "Okay. With every movie I'm hyped to see, I always need at least 2 showings for me to get a proper solid feeling on it. So for the last week I've left all my thoughts to myself for me to truly think how I feel about this movie. After my first showing, I loved it but I came out with a feeling I wasn't satisfied and it's probably because of the changes made from the novel whereas today I have no doubt in my head of how I feel. This movie is perfect.There's genuinely so much I love about this that if I wanted, I could go through every single scene and say how brilliant it is. Firstly with the movie itself, the pacing is just godly. How on earth is that an almost 3 hour movie when it flies by faster than sand in the wind. Secondly the sound editing? Unbelievable. The visuals are without a doubt just the best thing from VFX to camera work to cinematography.But finally the acting is where this movie shines. Every actor is honestly carrying this movie and that's what you expect with a stacked cast like this. Timothy is the definition of Paul Atreides. He was born for this role and I pray it's his legacy because he gave it his all and more. The scene in the sietch with his fathers ducal signet is one of the best scenes I've ever seen. His acting in the final scene is academy level he at the very least needs to be nominated.Zendaya does wonders for Chani especially for me. As a huge Dune series fan, Chani is a good character but she doesn't at all stand out in the books. But when she was announced to be played by Zendaya I knew this would be a twist and man I'm happy with the way Denis took her arc. She's probably my favourite character in the movie which is saying a lot with how she's not even top 10 in the books. It's crazy how much facial expressions does and Zendaya plays that perfectly. The love she has you can read it just as well as the anger at the end. I cannot wait to see how Denis uses her in Messiah especially with how she's on a complete different path now.The final actor that really stood out for me is Austin Butler. Doesn't have the biggest screen time but his role is perfect and I knew it the moment you hear him laughing in his arena battle. He plays this role in such a way it made me care for Feyd-Rautha even though he's a little no villain with little character outside of that. I could go on about every actor because they all do something that makes this movie special but yeah overall just a brilliant cast and a perfect movie.The final thing I have to say is that score that plays from the moment the Emperor kisses the Ducal signet till the end of the movie and the score during the credits, godly level of work from Zimmer he was the best choice for this movie and he delivered beyond perfection for both Parts.",

We are truly blessed to witness his work.With an Ensemble cast of industry veterans and Hollywood's future biggest and brightest stars, the casting of new characters can be considered as great.

    "Review Date": "2024-03-03",
    "Review Content": "When the screen turned black, I felt an intense sadness that this Is it. This is the greatest. This is the limit of what cinema can achieve.You can't talk about Dune without talking about religion. It somehow manages it to critique monotheistic religious concepts like Christianity and Islam, without ever feeling pretentious. It offers room to rethink the whole idea of religion. Every characters offers different perspective, and how someone perceives what exactly the film wants to say is up to them, but no matter what, I've never seen a film with such strong substance.For me, Dune is a demonstration that faith Is control, you can only guide a mass with belief, worshipping someone will always have horrific effects on society. Individuality is lost in the process of worshipping and existing-for-a-higher-reason.There is so much cultural influence from Christianity and Islam in Dune, and that makes it's story more realistic and interesting. It makes it clear that it's speaking towards these religious ideas, this is what makes Dune feel like less of an work of fiction, but more of an analysis and take on monotheistic religions intertwined with climate change in an science-fiction setting.Dune 2 It's filmmaking style Is literally the final stage of IMMERSIVE and INTENSE. I want to thank all the VFX- and sound design artists personally for making it feel like I'm living through this with the characters on arrakis. Words literally cannot explain what Dune 2 feels like. Jessica drinking the water of life, The whole first worm ride scene, the arena scene, the final knife fight... These are the scenes that got me the most goosebumps. But to be honest, the whole picture is made with so much care and love that makes it hard to choose a favorite.Denis Villeneuve just understands how to direct and motivate a crew properly. He made everyone do their job just so damn good, there is no single aspect that comes short, I missed these kind of films with so much care and love and vision, that it feels fresh again.But Dune 2, isn't just some film from that category. It deals with highly critical and ever-lasting topics, that'll always be important until the end of our very existence. It doesn't matter whether you're religious or not, everyone should see this film to see belief and worshipping from a different perspective. I love Dune 2, this is how films should hold mirrors up to society.",

    "Review Content": "I loved Dune part one, it was fresh, fascinating, beautiful, complex with great acting and story. It held the line of the story, things made sense even though not always clear. Dune part two however lost the rythm of the story and couldnt keep my interest up.The acting failed imo. Its like they all got drunk and stopped taking it serious. Timotheé Chalamet and Zendaya lacked chemistry. Where was the affection? It was just nothing there. For the rest of the cast I would say they equally lacked the dedicated acting we saw in part one. There was also little developing of the characters but that had more to do with the directing that the acting.The story, went from part ones constant action to a slow pace for the beginning 2.5 hours of part two, then everything happened in the last 20 minutes.If the first part had a complex story, part two did not. You wont have many surprices.The actionscenes are a mix, the CGI is great and flawless, the man to man fighting is pretty ridiculous and frankly stiff.But it is a big production wich means beautiful scenery, music and scenography, so its still a worthy watch.A couple mentions, I never understood why Zendayas character always looked angry in part one but she still looked angry throughout part two, why? Who knows.. but if there is a part three I hope this changes.Like part one this movie isnt free from politics. Its the usual stuff regarding gender and race.I gave it 8/10. With better acting I would have given it 9/10.",

    "Review Content": "I have waited for this movie so long. I got completely mesmerized by the first part and was eager to see how the second part of the story will be handled. And unfortunately, it was to my disappointment. Despite this movie is visually beautiful, it is not giving the same positive impression like the first one.First, it has weird cuts in the scenes and composition of these cuts doesn't work together. It gives the impression, they had too much material still left, but the movie was already 3 hours, so they needed to cut a bit from here and there and glue it all together.Second, it's missing up the work of building up the story the viewer would go through with the characters. Every storyline open is immediately to be closed or superficially treated. Understood, the novel is boosted, but they should keep it simple instead of adding unnecessary extra scenes. It felt as watching a long clip or trailer.Third, the new characters do not have time to present themselves in the story or evolve enough. The hype which was around Butler, Walken or Pugh's character wasn't fulfilled.Fourth, the iconic music was almost instantly missing. The great movie is partially made by great music, which in the first part was absolutely crucial. Here are very few scenes which are accompanied by music. That I consider as a pity.My conclusion: As taking a consideration, when I left cinema after seeing the first movie, when I felt full of chills and emotions and wanted to see that movie again. The second part left me with bittersweet emotionless feeling with no will to repeat. It is visually beautiful, but it feels empty as the story is not well done. The open ending also did not help to make the impression of this movie better. To be honest, I enjoyed the trailers more, that an experience of whole movie.",

Certainly it has the casting and production value to be great but upon watching it is such a let down compared to the first. As a director I love Denis Villeneuve but I feel like he's squandering his directorial might on dune. You can't just have amazing scenery and soundtrack without plot and scriptwriting to back it up which it does not. To me this is another indication that Hollywood has lost its way trending towards visuals over plot. I'm intrigued as to how they plan to salvage the franchise with part 3 but I think film enthusiasts need to be sceptical. How does a movie so lack lustre get such great reviews, review's that were better than the first? Are critics being paid off or are they brainwashed. Doesn't make much sense to me.",

The imagery created in this movie was beyond anything I had ever imagined while reading the book. The visual storytelling and world building beautifully condenses so much of Herbert's writing to focus on romance, revenge, betrayal, fundamentalism and transcendence. It is a different ride than part one. I won't provide any spoilers, but here are a few other random thoughts.I got a kick out of the brief but genuinely appreciative intro recorded for the special IMAX showing. I hope they start doing more of these. Hopefully it will get movie fans back in packed theaters because Dune: Part Two is an experience in IMAX that made the story better that I can't get at home. I love watching movies at home with subtitles, but I would have missed a lot visually if I focused on reading those.I left the theater somewhat overwhelmed by not just the IMAX technology and pace of storytelling, but also the parallels with current events of religious fundamentalism rebelling against corrupt, evil powers focused on maximizing wealth. The fact the movie packed in that much in under three hours was an achievement. I'm looking forward to rereading Herbert's books again.",

    "Review Content": "Dune: Part Two is the best cinematic experience i've ever had. I liked the first part for its cinematography, sound design and introduction of Frank Herbert's version of a Sci-Fi Fantasy. But the second part exceeds in nearly every aspect. Everyone liked Denis Villeneuve's \"Dune\" for establishing a modern Sci-Fi Fanatsy world but unlike Star Wars for example it was supposed to introduce to the world of Dune from the beginning; apart from the sound- and set-design and the SFX the story was rather simple. Not so \"Dune: Part Two\". The story picks up speed quickly and packs tons of plot in a short time whilst never sacraficing breathtaking and perfectly timed pictures and scenes. The cut is perfect and camera and SFX are even more astonishing than in the first film. The topics this film depicts leave extensive food for thought covering politics, mass manipulation through religion, fate and human behaviour. Personaly I sometimes thought I was presented with a summary of all \"Star Wars: The Clone Wars\" plots, which is a good thing. Maybe even including the humor; the film is funny at times, not like Marvel, but some may be disturbed by it. Personaly I was not. The only negative I noticed after finishing the film is that the score lacks a recognisable theme, the Arakis-Theme appears one or two times, but the quantity of leitmotifs isn't quite on a Star Wars level. I wouldn't say the film is perfect but rounding up from 9.99 leads me to my final rating of 10 Stars.",

I understand that character development is necessary, but as a sci-fi film, it could have benefited from more action and a better showcase of the technology they used. . Some of the technology we see is very interesting, and I would have loved to see more of it. When I left the theater, I felt that the movie missed the mark on some storytelling elements.

Denis Villeneuve has done an incredible job adapting a book that many thought was impossible to film.The score, cinematography, action sequences and visual effects establish the grand scale of this mesmerizing motion picture (Everything practically screams Academy Awards!), and the star cast is top-notch. Timothée Chalamet gives a formidable leading performance, Austin Butler portrays a compelling antagonist, and the rest of the cast is impressive, but the standout for me definitely was Rebecca Ferguson as Jessica (who I hope receives a Best Supporting Actress nomination at the upcoming Oscars).I absolutely can't wait for Dune: Messiah!P.

    "Review Content": "Dune: Part 2 not only surpasses the first film but elevates it, not many films are able to achieve such feat.Hans Zimmer returns and somehow outdoes himself bringing us a score that rattles you in your seat, memorable epic and somewhat melancholy.Greig Fraser returns, and just like Hans Zimmer he outdoes himself, memorable cinematography that will be imprinted in my head for a long time. The use of color is sublime, the black and white scene is incredible job well done.The performances are all incredible. Zendaya is the true stand out, but Timothée Chalamet is phenomenal, He speaks with such conviction and power This young man is gonna have an incredible career, his acting range is absurd! But the likes of Christopher waltz, Florence Pugh, Javier Bardem are all great! But let's not forget Austin freaking Butler delivering a villainess performance that will be remembered for the ages, menacing, cruel, brutal. The introduction to this character is perfect. You hate him, but you love him.This film doesn't shy away from politics and how it's used is so relevant to todays time, and it also doesn't shy away from the manipulation of politics and manipulation of power and Messiah like figures. It dives deep into religion and It's not afraid to show how it affects the characters.There truly is so much that happens in this film and it's done almost perfectly. I can't think of a flaw. I sat through the whole credits roll and I never do that. I was just speechless with this film. The third act is of the likes of The Two Towers, of the likes of Empire Strikes Back!.None of this would've been achieved without Denis Villeneuve, this man is putting together a resume that stands up to some of the greatest film makers to ever do it! His direction in this film is sublime there's a scene towards the end, where they specifically choose not to use the score and you feel the intensity of the fight on screen and it's powerful.A euphoric experience, a once in a lifetime theatrical experience, A film that isn't afraid to touch on subjects that some would consider taboo, it's simply a masterpiece through and through.",

    "Review Title": "Dune: Part Two - A Cinematic Triumph",
    "Review Date": "2024-03-02",
    "Review Content": "A visceral spectacle that transcends the boundaries of filmmaking, Dune: Part Two solidifies its place as a landmark achievement in cinematic history. Director Denis Villeneuve masterfully crafts a sequel that surpasses even its critically acclaimed predecessor, delivering a deeply affecting and visually stunning experience that will leave audiences awestruck.Picking up seamlessly from the events of the first film, Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) finds himself grappling with the weight of his destiny. Haunted by visions of a potential future ravaged by war, he embarks on a perilous journey to prevent this horrific fate from unfolding. This journey leads him deeper into the desert planet of Arrakis, where he forms a closer bond with Chani (Zendaya) and the Fremen tribe, embracing their culture and harnessing their unique abilities.Villeneuve's vision for Arrakis is brought to life with breathtaking detail. The vast sand seas are both awe-inspiring and unforgiving, while the brutalist architecture of the Harkonnen cityscapes exudes a menacing grandeur. Every frame is meticulously composed, utilizing a masterful blend of practical effects and CGI to create a world that feels both alien and strangely familiar.The performances are uniformly outstanding. Chalamet delivers a powerful and nuanced portrayal of Paul, capturing both the vulnerability and determination of a young man wrestling with immense responsibility. Zendaya shines as Chani, imbuing the character with strength, intelligence, and a deep connection to her Fremen heritage. The supporting cast is equally impressive, with Rebecca Ferguson, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, and Stellan Skarsgård delivering memorable performances that add depth and complexity to the narrative.Beyond the visuals and acting, Dune: Part Two excels in its thematic exploration. The film delves into complex questions of power, destiny, and the consequences of choice. It grapples with the cyclical nature of violence and the potential for hope amidst seemingly insurmountable obstacles. This depth, combined with the film's operatic scope, elevates it from a mere sci-fi spectacle to a powerful and thought-provoking cinematic experience.While the film does require prior knowledge of the first film or the source material to fully appreciate its nuances, it stands as a remarkable achievement in its own right. The narrative, while dense in world-building and character development, unfolds with a captivating pace, leaving audiences engrossed throughout the film's near three-hour runtime.In conclusion, Dune: Part Two is not simply a great science fiction film; it is a cinematic masterpiece. It is a testament to the power of visionary filmmaking, captivating storytelling, and exceptional performances.This is a film that deserves to be seen on the biggest screen possible, preferably with an immersive sound system. It is a true spectacle in every sense of the word, and an experience that will stay with you long after the credits roll.",

    "Review Content": "As someone who found the first Dune movie plodding and too focused on the weakest parts of the book I didn't have high expectations for \"Part Two\". However it quickly became clear \"Part Two\" was a whole different beast from the first movie -- retaining the first's gorgeous shots and massive sets but with a much tighter focus on the book series' strength in political intrigue and warfare.While watching \"Dune: Part Two\" it didn't feel like I was watching sci-fi as much as it felt like I was watching one of the great historical epics in Spartacus or Gladiator. They hit it out of the park in almost every respect.Overall I came away feeling this was a generational sci-fi, in conversation for the best of the past 20 years.",

They visually and sonically expressed the story better than my mind could while reading it.I understand you cannot put the complete story and world building in just 2,5 hours but. But even so the essence remaines and keeps the story going.Dune elevates the art of book-to-film adaptations, a rare feat in capturing the essence of Frank Herbert's intricate universe. The meticulous craftsmanship extends to the characters, portrayed with depth and nuance. The cinematography is breathtaking, capturing the desolate beauty of Arrakis and the grandeur of its political intrigues. Hans Zimmer's score intensifies the emotional resonance, creating an immersive experience. Performances, especially from the stellar cast, bring authenticity to iconic characters.I walked out of the cinema buzzing and wowed 30 minutes ago, still am. That only happened twice before. I guess its in my top three :)",

    "Review Content": "I don't often rate a movie a 10, my favorites are usually 8 or 9. But this is the definition of the 10, looks and personality! In all seriousness Denis Villeneuve created something that can only be described as huge, epic, grandiose while still developing characters and applying beautiful detail. I love how he set up so many things in the first film to be paid off in part two, shots of the dessert mouse Maud Dib, Paul's awareness of Gurney Halleck's gate...\nJavier Bardem as Stilgar absolutely crushes it. He couldn't be better and deserves Oscar(another) recognition. Timothy goes from a boy in the first to leading man that demands your attention, both as an actor an in his character.I'm a Dune reader, and of course things had to be cut from the book but I appreciate DV's selectiveness to make it a believable universe. Very rarely does this happen but the movies may just outshine the source material.I've never watched at 3 hour movie and wished it was 5. Though it will probably be years I can't wait for Dune Messiah.",

I was both elated and grieved when the atomics went off and when Feyd Rautha fights Paul... why, because I knew the end of the story was coming. I couldn't get enough. Denis pulls off the spectacle and the story in such a marriage of wonder that it would be wise that no attempt is ever made again to make this book into a movie... this IS the book. Every character is solid, totally sold on every actor's portrayal of their character. Author Butler was a malevolent masterpiece, Timothee Chalamet truly shows us Paul, the teenage child grow into the Lisan Al Gaib. This is going to be the canonical trio of this generation just as Star Wars 4/5/6 was of the past. Nothing better.",

    "Review Date": "2024-03-01",
    "Review Content": "THE STORY:\nDune is one of the most complex, ambitious, and incredible stories ever written. Its vast plot lines, characters, and lore make for a story so intriguing and epic that by 2 films, it's already competing with the likes of Star Wars. Part Two expands on everything Part One sets up and more. There's more at stake, more to unpack, and more to set up (but in the best way). The addition of new characters, more lore, and an epic set up for the future make this both a worthy conclusion of the first chapter and an incredible set up for what's to come.\"This is only the beginning.\" - ChaniMY FAVORITE CHARACTERS (LADY JESSICA):\nLady Jessica was an easy 2nd favorite of mine when it came to the characters. Like Paul, (which I'll go into later), her character grows so much from part one. She's so much more of a villain this round, and it made all of her interactions with Paul and the cast so unnerving and unsettling. The Bene Gesserit are such an interesting collection of people, and their mystique is displayed perfectly. You can never tell where Jessica or any of them align, making for some of the most interesting scenes.\"You chose the wrong side.\" - Lady JessicaMY FAVORITE CHARACTERS (FEYD RAUTHA):\nFeyd Rautha is such a brutal villain. Austin Butler is the best possible casting for this, though I also think Bill Skarsgård would've done great too. Though he has limited screen time, Austin as Feyd brings such a menacing presence to the screen. I'd honestly link him up with some of the greats like Heath Ledger's Joker, JK Simmons's Terence Fletcher, and Anthony Hopkins's Hannibal Lector. He carries each and every scene he's in.\"Kiss my feet!\" - Feyd RauthaMY FAVORITE CHARACTERS (PAUL ATREIDES):\nPaul Atreides goes from predictable protagonist in Part One to something so much more complex in Part Two. Going from doing whatever guides his heart to doing whatever benefits the wellbeing of the universe, Paul ascends far above hero level. Paul isn't a hero in this, he's literally a messiah. He does what is needed for the benefit of all, not just those he cares for. Dennis translates Paul's \"anti-hero\" character so well in fact, that Paul has risen to be one of favorite protagonists in all of literature.\"Lead them to Paradise.\" - Paul AtreidesMY THOUGHTS:\nI knew this was going to surpass part one, but I didn't know by how much. Dune: Part Two is genuinely one of the best movies I've ever seen. Like I mentioned in my first review, it's one of few films that I truly think deserves the word perfection. It's a masterpiece in both sci-fi and in general. It's one of the greatest science fiction films ever made, akin to the likes of The Empire Strikes Back and 2001: A Space Odyssey. It'll stand the test of time, and it'll be brought up in conversations decades down the road. I know I'm still in the Dune hype zone, but truly, this is one of the best things I've seen in a theater. If not top 5, it's AT LEAST a guaranteed top 10. Never will I recommend a film more...than Dune: Part Two.This is cinema. This is perfection. Yes, I'm glazing this film, and \"Long live the fighters.\" - Paul Atreides.",

It not only embraces the epic scope of Herbert's novels but also captures the nuanced themes and aesthetics that have been a constant thread throughout Villeneuve's career. Each frame is a carefully crafted tableau, reflecting the director's commitment to storytelling excellence.\"Dune: Part Two\" is more than a sequel; it's a triumph of craft and storytelling. It skillfully mirrors the political intrigue of its predecessor, only to unravel deeper layers of complexity. The hubristic political gamesmanship gives way to the tragic weaponization of religion, providing a thought-provoking commentary on power dynamics and societal structures.Javier Bardem's portrayal adds an extra layer of brilliance to the film. His iconic sandworm surfing scene not only showcases the film's visual grandeur but also injects moments of sheer delight into the narrative. It's a perfect encapsulation of how \"Dune: Part Two\" strikes a delicate balance between gravitas and entertainment.In summary, \"Dune: Part Two\" is not just a sequel; it's a cinematic milestone that elevates the source material to unprecedented heights.

Several scenes were long, but it never felt boring or dragged out, my attention was always present throughout the whole film, which is impressive, considering the length.I got goosebumps multiple times, but the two most memorable times was first when Paul was riding the worm. It was shot in a way that you as the viewer, especially in the cinema with those Dolby Atmos speakers, feel like you're riding it yourself, unreal.The other time was when all the Fremen was worshipping him, when he truly became the Muad'dib, waking up and being able to see both past and future.To top it all off, the music and scenery is... 🎩 off to everyone who worked on this, and my favorite composer, Hans Zimmer.

Main theme, in my opinion, is the importance of relegion and politics, and the influence it has on us. The Bene-Gesserit were shown so beautifully in this movie-their role, influence and power they have in Dune universe. Frank Herbert is a genius for his time, and the themes he writes about are relevant, both then and nowdays. This movie is absolutely worthy of every praise it gets. Many might not understand it because they haven't read the book, and that willa affect their opinion of this movie, but i think it's fantastic. Yes, a few thing were changed, not necessarily for the better, but it has to be that way in order for such a complex piece to be understood to the broather audience.The first and second part are so much different (in a good way). The chang that characters go through (Paul, Jessica) are so incredibly shown, and you can clearly see that they are a a completely different person by the end of the second movie.Special praises to Denis Villeneuve, he is a genius\nI got goosebumps far too much times throughout this movie because of the music which is absolutely mesmerizing.I really hope there will be a third part, and can't wait to go and see this movie many more tikes in theaters.",

Chalamet was perfect for the coming-of-age stage of Paul's character and he nailed his part in Part One and the first hour of Part Two. But could he play the part of a bloodthirsty military leader hellbent on revenge, and later the role of a reluctant Emperor of the Known Universe?Yes. Chalamet exudes charisma. He has in him a powerful masculine voice and is able to deliver combat sequences well. His depressed and sullen acting perfectly embodies the curse and the pain of prescience, the tragic necessity of the Golden Path at the expense of the prescient mind's humanity.Seeing him play the part of a messianic military leader, I wouldn't mind seeing Chalamet try a hand in playing an action hero after bulking up a bit.",

    "Review Title": "Duke of Arrakis",
    "Review Date": "2024-03-04",
    "Review Content": "Let me begin by saying that if Dune: Part Two was released last year undelayed, Oppenheimer would've had a formidable opponent at the Oscars.(SPOILER ALERT)The screenplay is one of the best I've seen in all commercial films, as the credit goes not only to Frank Herbert's work, but also the scriptwriter's adaptation and the director's execution. After a short monologue of Irulan that contextualizes the narrative, the movie continues with Paul's adaptation to the Fremen life, divergence with his mother's belief, and sprouts of love with Chani. Just as I thought that the story will follow the path of Avatar, the audience are pulled out of the main plot to explore other aspects of the Dune universe: Feyd-Rautha's maniacal rise, the Bene Gesserit's bloodline scheme, and Alia's subtle influence through Jessica - and then we're brought back to Paul's arc through Gurney Halleck. Although a lengthy second act, the story is compact, the development intricate, and the pacing thoroughly controlled. However, the final act is a dip compared to the meticulous lead-up, as everything seems in a hurry of wrapping up for Paul's destined ascension, most notably the war's sudden halt and the Emperor's quick surrender.Furthermore, Villeneuve maintains his high standard for aesthetic design, whether the utilitarian machinery, exotic costumes, or the panoramic long shots. What stood out to me the most was the triangular colosseum at the monochromatic planet of Giedi Prime: a dark sun hovers above waves of colorless spectators, as black blood is spilled upon white sand. Never have I thought the ink-painting-style fireworks could go so well along HR Giger's biomechanical architecture, all contributing to the portrayal of the Harkonnens' cruelty and eeriness.The action sequences are also spot-on, as Paul and Feyd's fateful duel is fluently choreographed and progressively captivating. My favorite of all is Paul's worm ride, a perfect segment in length, editing, performance, and visual. Little words were spoken, so suspense is built solely through character reaction, the sound of roaring sand, and the fastening tempo of shot-cutting. As Paul steadies himself on the worm's back, Hans Zimmer's six-note theme erupts alongside the Fremen's cheering. Chani gasps, Stilgar dumbfounded, and the Lisan al Gaib has risen.I also like how the centripetal topic of prophecy versus free will is depicted in the film. Interestingly, the movie approaches this heavy subject with comedy, for instance when Stilgar and the believers admire over Paul's humility when he refuses his identity as the messiah. However, as we accompany the young Atreides' journey up until his resurrection from the Water of Life, the prophecy, either artificially or naturally, is becoming reality as his story unfolds. Those who were laughed upon as superstitious turned out to be completely right. And yet, given Paul's unquestionable power and apathy in the end, is the prophecy truly a foresight of the future, or is it a manipulation?A movie that balances commercial needs and artistic excellence. Absolutely stunning!",

Part two does justice to the first book and the adaptations, such as Alia not being born yet, didn't bother me at all. I understand it would have been an impossible task to find a child actor for the part. The cinematography and the music were, again, simply outstanding. As was Timothee Chalamet.

    "Review Content": "After several years, here it is. It's better than the first film and carries on Villeneuve's undeniable knack for phenomenal visuals and sound design, but the substance of the story itself was about as boring as you'd imagine a featureless desert planet to be. Not to mention it's weirdly orientalist.Many scenes have abstract and overbaked cinematography that borders on downright self-indulgence. Despite a few epic highlights and eye-catching shots, the story itself boils down to several fights and explosions that amount to an upmarket Michael Bay flick. Premonitions of divinity and tedious ceremonial rites hog swathes of the runtime as we're ushered into forced reverence of an unremarkable Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet). It feels like an intentional plot-building film, an interlude-steppingstone, which is not a good thing because it's relying on your interest in a future film (Messiah), not this one.Unlike Sci-Fi greats, George Lucas's Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back comes to mind, this film nearly entirely lacks a complex ensemble of vibrant and interesting characters with engaging interplay, repartees, and intelligent dialogue. Lucas took some inspiration from Frank Herbert and (most importantly) formatted the genre for the big screen; making a watchable, likeable and memorable Sci-Fi epic that is now beloved by millions, with a lore that has incredibly rare profundity; even spawning a religion (Jediism). Dune's lore *is* interesting too, it's just poorly represented here.This film is humourless and flat. The characters had very few interesting things to say. Entertainment was thrown out in exchange for drearily over-serious solemnity. When many costumes are point-blank laughable, I cannot take the film unironically seriously. Various themes are often too obviously borrowed from elsewhere; Harkonnens from the Soviets (the Baron is called \"Vladimir\"), or the Fremen from Muslim North Africans resisting a colonial force. Earthling motifs take you back to Earth, not to Arrakis.7.2/10.",

    "Review Content": "Dune 1 is better in everyway possible. You can predict the plot of Dune 2 so easily. It's so cringey too. Drink a blue liquid and become God. Kill your 5 second grandpa cause it's cool. Your grandpa who was bathing all day. Wonderful right?It's so long and dragged. You learn absolutely nothing. There is not much Epic-ness. If this movie was not taken by Denis or didn't have Hans Zimmer this movie will definitely suck balls and would have flopped.The fight scene are meh (except final battle), Romance is meh, Music meh, Story meh, Acting meh. Everything feels meh. Maybe that's the problem.Watch Dune 2 if you are lazy to read the books and will eat anything Denis puts out. If you're someone who likes a good story or good action avoid at all cost.Part 1 felt soulful, it was awesome it had good music, i can name 3 scenes in part 1 than in part 2.The middle chapter. Feels off too. The lead to the next big thing. Yayyy!! Let's wait for another 3 years for another garbage. Yes!!!!",

    "Review Content": "Dune: Part 2 is an extraordinary feat of filmmaking. Director Denis Villeneuve concludes Paul Atredies' (Timothee Chalamet) story with brilliance, while never sacrificing the human and ethical elements.Part 2 picks up where the first film left off. Granted, this film isn't technically a sequel, as it continues from the first half of Frank Herbert's beloved classic. In a way, Part 2 enhances the first half due to the ramifications that follow. Paul's story of finding out if he's the chosen one while earning the respect of the Fremen - specifically Chani (Zendaya) and Stilgar (Javier Bardem) - is one of the more fascinating aspects.Paul's story is only one aspect of the narrative, as the Harkonnen family - led by the imposing Stellan Skarsgård - is still trying to wipe the Fremen off of Arrakis. Dave Bautista returns as the impulsive Rabban, while new addition Austin Butler plays the Baron's nephew, Feyd-Rautha - a psychotic rockstar of a character who's well-trained in combat.Butler is one of the movie's standouts. His introduction as a challenger in a gladiatorial celebration on the Harkonnen planet of Giedi Prime is one of the more haunting and unique sequences I've seen in some time. Viewers might find the villains to be one-dimensional, and in a way, they are. However, they're still imposing enough that the point comes across clearly.Familiar characters return such as Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), and others - I won't go into detail if you haven't read the book. Suffice it to say their character development is just as impactful as Paul's. This is made all the more important given the rapid pace of scenes that range from quiet and contemplative, to action-packed and invigorating.Viewers also shouldn't slouch on the technical aspects of the film. Villeneuve returns with cinematographer Greig Fraser and composer Hans Zimmer. Greig's photography rivals his previous work in such a way that he might get nominated next year. Likewise, Zimmer's score is captivating within the context of the action scenes, and emotional at the film's bittersweet ending.By the end of the film, I couldn't help but feel a sense of sadness, as I'd enjoyed being in this strange - yet captivating - universe. If you get the chance, be sure to see it on the biggest screen possible. I could go on forever about how much I loved this film, but I'll just say: go see this movie.Villeneuve has proven, yet again, why he is one of the greatest directors of our time by doing the impossible: adapting one of the most beloved, unfilmable books ever made.",

Dune part 2 was executed to perfection and is a love letter to the fans who've read the book along with the people who haven't, I strongly suggest reading the book as Villeneuve leaves a lot unsaid (a lot of internal monologue within the book) all while implying it through the actions of the characters, and as someone who has read the book, it was so wonderful to experience that. The film itself is truly beautiful, heartbreaking and full of lessons within lessons that give a true insight into the struggles of people in our world. I think the film truly encapsulates the idea of 'there are no sides' that the books tried so hard to impart, thank you Denis Villeneuve for bringing a story I loved so much, to life, in the most spectacular fashion.",

Impressed truly doesnt even begin to embody and sense of the granduity of DPT.DPT seamlessly picks up from where DPO left off, creating an even more immersive experience. Nonetheless, beyond my imaginable capabilities somehow DPT increases the meticulous level of attention and detail to the films mise én scene.The costumes once again go above and beyond, I'm not sure how to even put it into words. They looked real. They fit the scenes. They looked like they belong.The musical score, I didn't think it could get better than DPO - I stand a fool! The musical score for DPT leaves you with goosebumps for almost the entirety of the runtime. If it doesn't achieve an award I will truly battle the great houses myself!The visual effects. Lost for words, truly dont think I could encompass how good they are here. You'll have to lead on faith for this one.All the actors and actresses complete this film, not like it's their job, but something they truly want to work on and truly do beyond their capabilities for and this shows.The hype is real. The spice must flow. The third Dune must come.If you liked DPO you will lose it for DPT. Enough said.",

    "Review Content": "I had the opportunity to see this film at a pre-premiere and I was pleasantly shocked when the credits had been flying before my eyes for several minutes.Denis Villeneuve did not give the viewer any transitions and continued the story straight away, and it must be admitted that the second part turned out better than the first. The scale is even more fascinating, the culture and features of the universe began to be revealed, the characters develop and attract attention. The grandeur and epic nature of the buildings, ships and battles are breathtaking. If we compare this film with Star Wars, then we can compare these films only in terms of the scale of the films' impressions and the possible legendarity in the future, but definitely not thematically or genre-wise. Dune is much darker, more serious, and more concerned with developing its characters. Separately, I would like to praise the costume designers and sound designers who created a visual and sound sequence that is truly impressive. There are many details that require a re-watch of the film to appreciate the care and beauty of their work.We have finally reached a level of technological development in cinema where such complex works as Dune can be turned into a three-hour delight. Huge respect and applause to the entire film team!",

It is impossible not to comment on the action scenes, as in the first film there were few and not many were well directed, here Denis Villeneuve corrects this small flaw and delivers breathtaking action scenes, especially the large-scale war (holy war) of the third act of the film, which can easily be compared with the epic battles of the Lord of the Rings franchise.

    "Review Title": "A Spectacular Cinematic Achievement",
    "Review Date": "2024-03-03",
    "Review Content": "Dune Part Two, the second half of Denis Villeneuve's ambitious two part adaptation of Frank Herbert's seminal 1965 sci-fi classic, feels like a blockbuster to end all blockbusters, a monumental cinematic achievement. While the Lord of the Rings comparisons may be pretty obvious, especially since Herbert's novel is often considered the sci-fi equivilent of Tolkien's epic fantasy trilogy, it absolutely fits here because if 2021's Dune (or Dune Part One) felt like filmmaking on an epic scale that we hadn't seen since Peter Jackson first transported audiences to Middle Earth with The Fellowship of the Ring back in 2001, Dune Part Two feels like filmmaking on a level that we haven't seen since The Two Towers in 2002. On top of that, Villeneuve and Jackson's adaptations of their respective novels have a lot in common, as both find a perfect blend of straight up, accurate adaptation of the material while also finding ways to expand upon the themes of the novels in a way that feels respectful and makes sense.Dune Part Two is the perfect example of the \"when everybody does their part for the group project\" meme. Whether it's Villeneuve and Jon Spaihts' script, which perfectly blends humor, drama, action and even horror in a way that makes the nearly 3 hour runtime fly by, to an all time great score by Hans Zimmer, who truly feels as if he's firing on all cylinders in awaythat he really hasn't before, to Grieg Fraser's breathtaking cinnematography that brings the different planets that make up the Dune universe (Dune-iverse??) to life (the black and white gladiator arena sequence on the Harkonnen home world of Giedi Prime in particular is a key standout), to the stunning and immersive production and costume design by Patrice Vermette and Jacqueline West respectively, everything comes together to create a film that not only builds upon the strengths of its predecessor, but far surpasses it, cementing itself alongside the likes of the afformentioned Two Towers, T2, The Godfather Part Two and The Empire Strikes Back as one of the all time great cinematic sequels. That's to say nothing of the acting, which is also phenomenal. Timothée Chalamet cements that he was perfectly cast as the series' awkward, reluctant messiah/chosen one, Paul Atreides. While it would admitedly be easy for some of Paul's decisions, actions and dialogue to come off as whiny or insufferable, Chalamet chooses to lean into Paul's apprehension and reluctance to taking on a role/title that was imposed on him by the people around him, while at the same time, dealing with the very real grief he feels over basically everybody he loved and most of his family being senselessly massacred by the Harkonnens and basically becoming the leader of not only his family but of the royal House Atreides basically overnight, resulting in easily Chalamet's best performance to date. Rebecca Fergusson's Lady Jessica continues to metaphorically and also quite literally be mother. In fact, she's so good at being mother that this film gives her the title of Reverend Mother (which in Bene Geserit terms is basically the ultimate mother). Javier Bardem's Stilgar proves to be the comedic heart of the film while not being reduced to a laughing stock or a purely comedic character and, along with Lady Jessica, serves as the perfect representation of the film's themes of religious fervor and fanaticism. On the flipside, there's Zendaya's Chani, who, along with Paul, serves as the more skeptical counter to the adult's religious fanaticism. Chani is easily the film's MVP. After so much buildup for her appearance in Part One (which famously lead to people getting \"Zendaya-baited\" by the movie because she was such a huge part of the promotion for the film and ultimately had like 5 minutes of screentime in the actual movie), Chani both is and isn't the character you expect her to be, even if you've read the book. Villeneuve, Spaihts and Zendaya herself give Chani some much needed depth and complexity that truly elevates her character. As for the newcomers, Austin Butler is easily the standout. Butler brings all the rockstar energy and swagger that he brought to the role of Elvis but dials it up to 11 to his chilling portrayal of the murderous and psychotic Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen and steals every single scene he's in. However, not all the characters fare so well. While we certainly get more of Stellan Skarsgard's Baron Vladamir Harkonnen and Dave Bautista's Glossu \"Beast\" Rabban than we got in Part One and their performances are great (especially Bautista's, who really gets to showcase Rabban's physicality and why he has the nickname \"Beast\" in his scenes), they aren't given nearly as much depth as the heroes are. While their motivations are clearly defined, they don't hsve the depth of someone like Paul or Chani. The other newcomers who aren't Butler (Christopher Walken as the Emperor, Florence Pugh as his daughter Princess Irulan and Lea Sedoux as Bene Geserit sister Lady Margot Fenring) really drew the short end of the stick when it comes to screentime but with a story as character dense as Dune, that was bound to happen.It isn't all positive though. Even with two films that have a combined runtime of nearly 6 hours, Dune is such a dense book (the book iw over 600 pages and the audio book version I listened to on Audible clocked in at just over 21 hours), it's possible to TRULY adapt all of Dune, and some elements of the story do feel somewhat rushed due to Villeneuve and Spaihts opting to change what in the book is a time jump of a couple years during which Paul and the Fremen disrupt spice production and Maud'Dib becomes a figure feared by the Harkonnens and Imperium alike to a couple of months (if even) in the movie, which, in the longrun isn't something that deeply impacts the story, but it does make certain smaller details make less sense as we near the film's climax. That being said, Villeneuve and Spaihts are clearly aware that doing a *fully accurate* adaptation of Dune with the two movie constraint that they had was nigh impossible, so they opted to omit certain things, condense others, and in some cases, add things, all while keeping true to the spirit and themes of Herbert's novel to the point that it's clear that they both have a deep reverence for the novel. Given how Dune Part Two ends off, I have no doubt that the inevitable conclusion to Villeneuve's trilogy, Dune Part Three/Dune: Messiah will also take liberties with adapting ITS source novel as well, and if the first two parts are anything to go by, that'll be for the best.Dune Part Two is, without question, one of the greatest sci-fi films ever made and a standout in Denis Villeneuve's already incredible filmography. While it's very easy for a movie to get way too overhyped way too quickly, in the case of Dune Part Two, ABSOLUTELY believe the hype. Believe the hype and see it on the biggest IMAX screen you can, just as Villeneuve intended, or if you're lucky enough to see be living near a theater that's showing it in 70mm film, as I did for my second screening, do yourself a favor and see it in that format too. (But, if you do that, do yoursef a favor and also see it in IMAX. Movies like this are why IMAX was invented).",

With her performance, she also seemed a little outside of the Dune universe. Lastly, Glossu Harkonnen got a wicked nerf bat in Part 2, which was a tad strange; in the first, he was perceived as brutal and fearless, and in Part 2, he was a coward and a screw-up.

Timothee and Zendaya return with some new cast members. Christopher plays the Emperor and Austin plays a psychotic killer-he likes to use knives-and he works for Christopher. Timothee continues his training in the desert, mostly learning how to ride the sand worms but also some tactical fighting, too, which he puts to good use. Zendaya helps with his training in walking in the sand-you need to act like you are drunk to confuse the worms-and becomes his love interest. Lots of fights over the control of the spice and there is a blue fluid that is drained from the worms that has different effects on males and females. Some of the smaller cameo roles from part one-Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem & Dave Bautista-do have bigger parts in this installment.It's rated PG-13 for violence and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 46 minutes.I liked this part better than the first one and it would be a good one to see in the theaters.",

Austin Butler is great, but he's hardly in the movie.-All the talk of Messiah and Holy War are repeated many times, but I was never sold on it.

The emotional connection between Paul and Chani, so vital to the story, is completely lacking and unbelievable. The two main characters are good looking enough but has absolutely zero chemistry on screen.I am certain Zendaya is a fine actress in some things, but she has basically 2 facial expressions here, and the one she uses the most is a scowl directed at Paul. I found her to be the worst part of this movie.The final fight scene is short, choppy, and a mess. It felt anticlimactic and unfulfilling\nThe Harkonens are basically reduced to bumbling villainy almost cartoonish. The ending was super abrupt, and was so different from the book that it left me wondering what the filmmakers would do if they want to do a sequel.I want to reiterate that this isn't a bad movie.

That was FAR from the case. I was engaged throughout the film and on the edge of my seat at multiple times. The music, the acting, the costumes, cinematography- All so so so so good.*this is the part of the review where I don't have enough characters to post so I'm just going to ramble on. The movie was amazing. Go see it. It actually lives up to the hype and I cannot wait to see it again. I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since I saw it.",

    "Review Title": "Nailed everything but music missed the vibe of the book",
    "Review Date": "2024-03-01",
    "Review Content": "This is not going to be a popular review but I'm writing as someone who has read the book, is a fan of Villeneuve's work and couldn't wait for part 1. And even more part 2. To arrive. After watching the first movie I understood that those who had never read the book didn't get to appreciate how perfect job Denis Villeneuve had done, but fortunately many did, me among them, as it laid the path for the second part to unveil in it's glory. And in so many ways it did. Before I went to see this movie I've read the first reviews, especially the usually critical ones from the book fans and couldn't understand why're they always so picky, especially for Villeneuve, even if the movie in some of its parts strays away from the book. Never had that kind of critical view on the book adaptations as I understood that the directors job, freedom and subsequently risk is to choose a path and express their artistic interpretation. After viewing the second instalment I still don't see any bad things about how this movie was made regardless of it's differences from the book. It doesn't lose anything from the Dune story at all. Everything about this movie is top of the tops. Except one thing. My critical point about the second part of the Dune movie is the one of the most praised things in all the reviews. The musical score from the music grand master Hans Zimmer. Everyone praised it but I found way over the top, completely missed and messed up the whole vibe. Basically from the start this music and it's effects immerse you in extremely fearful and dark vibe sound pool that never leaves this 166min instalment. There are couple of times that the music atmosphere went to a calmer side but this was like ugly vibes all over the place, regardless who's in the scene... it was a constant. My take is that classic mixing the atmospheric sounds depending on the side showing would make it definitely better because the book doesn't have that evil vibe all the time at all. The book is a clear fight of good and evil and there are many divine or spiritual moments opposing the darkness in the book that emphasize that fight, light against the dark. Even prana the yogic life force of God (from vedic culture) is mentioned in the book. Among these sound effects that were shaking the whole hall, it was hard to swallow the voice of Lisan Al Gaib's demonic voice (as well as his mother) when he became one with everything, enhanced with a cruise ship subwoofer sound effect. That being said, Timothee Chalamet is not the best pick for the role, just can't see the charisma of Paul with his skinny appearance and face, standing tough like Ronaldo before taking the freekick. Paul should have eyes that speak everything and this Italian teenager lookalike, although good, just felt flat like he's trying to hard. Zendaya surprisingly great, constantly amazing Rebecca Ferguson has that charisma of stealing the screen presence and two best roles Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem made the center of the bullseye. Movie has the perfect scenery. Really everything is spot on but the music vibe kinda ruined it for me. That's not to say that mr. Hans Zimmer made a bad product, he did masterfully as always. But compared to the book it's too extreme, too dark or evil and missing the vibe of the story, in my humble opinion. I can see that dark things excite a lot of people today and so this music score is not a surprise in that way. But not for me. Another note, the media critics are writing about this movie grandiosity by comparing it to the Lord of the rings. Love and respect both but Dune doesn't come even close to LOTR masterpiece trilogy. This is another one of their empty, sensationalistic exaggerations.",

The first film set up so many glorious avenues, each picking up threads laid out in the book. The sequel jettisons many of these, in favor of new storylines that diminish Herbert's original vision. Gone are the meditative bears from the original, and in its place are Marvelized action set pieces and down the middle dialogue exchanges. Zero talk of the spacing guild, the true villains of the original, and instead they made the Bene Gesserits the architects of disaster, why? Felt wrong on many levels.

    "Review Content": "Had the pleasure to watch this film in an early screening and was completely blown away.As a big fan of the Game of Thrones franchise, it's been a long time since iv'e encountered this level of world-building and epicness. Would highly recommend to re-watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better, though it's not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self-contained and would please general audience that only watched the first movie 3 years ago just as well.Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time, and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high-budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does.In my personal opinion, the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect. Hans Zimmer's score is masterful just as you'd expect, and one step up from the Oscar winner and Grammy nominated score of Pt. 1. Technical aspects such as VFX, Production Design, Sound, Editing, etc. Are all top notch and awards-worthy. The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine. Denis direction is impeccable, and the story is absolutely fascinating- continuing to develop characters from Pt. 1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters.The movie serves as a great wrap-up to the story introduced in Pt. 1 however in my opinion could serve as an even better set-up to a possible masterpiece in Dune: Messiah, which I really hope will get green-lit soon.I believe (and surely hope) this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season. Below-the-line wins are pretty much guaranteed right now, but I hope it will get some love in above-the-line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture, perhaps to break stigmas presented agains this Fantasy/Sci-Fi genre in recent years at the academy. As a big fan of the genre, unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period, perhaps it's time for a movie like this to triumph once again.Don't miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX, since I believe it's an historic piece of epic-Fantasy/Sci-Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre.",

Dune Part 2 is an instant classic, the best science fiction film produced this century, and proof that in the cinema, imagery and sound remain king. Fans of the book and newcomers to the world of Dune will be in awe of the secrets that lay waiting for them in the desert of Arrakis.

The acting was inconsistent and disappointing. Not sure how you flop this bad when the first film was done so right.However that being said usually the second film of a trilogy is to build the story which they did in this film. I liked the original Dune better in this regard even though they didn't give us much. Let's see if they can close the series out properly.",

    "Review Content": "My wife and I attended a screening of Dune II (2024) last night. The storyline follows Paul as he establishes himself among the Fremen, torn between being seen as a messiah and viewing himself as an ordinary man seeking revenge. His budding relationship with Chani adds complexity, as he grapples with love versus the expectations of becoming a Messiah. Meanwhile, the success in repelling world invaders attracts a formidable opponent poised to stop them and annihilate the Fremen.Directed by Denis Villeneuve (Blade Runner 2049), the film stars Timothée Chalamet (Wonka), Zendaya (Euphoria), Josh Brolin (No Country for Old Men), Javier Bardem (No Country for Old Men), Austin Butler (Elvis), Christopher Walken (Deer Hunter), David Bautista (Guardians of the Galaxy), and Florence Pugh (Black Widow).Dune Part Two is a cinematic masterpiece. The cinematography excels with brilliant use of lighting, attire, camera angles, and settings, crafting an atmospheric and expansive experience. Exceptional makeup and costumes contribute to a mysterious and authentic feel throughout. The characters are unpredictable, exuding grit and determination. The mother's role is outstanding, and the conversations with the sister are mind-blowing. The inclusion of the worms seamlessly fits into the underlying and overarching storyline. The film immerses you in its universe and slowly builds anticipation for the epic battle. The action, when it unfolds, is brutal, intense, and keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. My only critique is that the film could have been better edited for length.In conclusion, Dune Part Two is a remarkable addition to the science fiction genre and a must-see epic. I would rate it 9/10 and highly recommend.",

The acting is superb, the visuals and cinematography are amazing, the music/lack thereof enhances scenes. I absolutely love the costumes. There is so much to like. I've never read the books, I haven't seen the 1980's movie, I even only recently saw Part One. Going in blind still has blown me away. Some movies really struggle to immerse you and make you feel like a fictional world could be real, this movie is not one.Timothee really steals the show for me once he comes back to life. He really seemed untouchable and has a commanding presence. The duel between him and Na-Baron was intense, and I loved how there wasn't any music for that fight. The worm riding scene was so cool too.. heck, I thought Chani showing Paul how to properly sand walk was great (the shot with the close up of her feet).The only knocks I have against this movie are when Paul is supposed to survive in the desert alone, then shortly meets Chani. Then suddenly they're out with a bunch of Fremen taking on a spice harvester? It seemed as though they rushed Paul and Chani's relationship a bit. Also, when Paul doesn't want to go south, but then decides to. He ends up drinking the life water. Did he need to do that? I'm not sure if that was explained, or if I missed it. Some of the Harkenen scenes with the coliseum as well as the shots of the army didn't have the greatest special effects to me, but that might've been intentional.Overall, the few problems I had with the movie really aren't that big of a deal. I saw it in IMAX which was a good idea! I'm looking forward to being able to see this again. To me, this is more of a 9.5/10. Might end up changing it to a 10 after another viewing, we will see.

    "Review Content": "'Dune: Part Two' comes 2.5 years after the first film, and hopefully a final film to make it a trilogy in 3-4 years. It picks up pretty much straight after the first film, with Paul (Chalamet) and his mum Jessica (Ferguson) being shown how to live in the Arrakis desert by the Fremen, particularly Chani (Zendaya) and Stilgar (Bardem). There they continue to fight a guerrilla war against the Harkonnen.To go along with the 'big bad bald' Baron (Skarsgard), we get his two nephews - the angry Beast (Bautista) and the psychotic Feyd-Rautha (Butler), who has a big role to play in the final act. We also get introduced to those pulling galactic strings from another planet, the Emperor (Walken) and his daughter, Princess Irulan (Pugh). There's a few chess pieces in play, but even though it goes for 2 hour 40min, the pacing is generally quite fast and everything really comes together at the end, with Paul embracing his \"messiah\" role.I'll need to rewatch this, but it's certainly up there with some of the best sci-fi films - better than the first film, and certainly an excellent sequel, similar to 'The Empire Strikes Back'. The cinematography, costumes, score (or lack of in the final fight), set-design and CGI are all superb. It certainly makes it feel like you've witnessed something special and want to see what comes next.",

This was a masterpiece, everything was incredible, the cinematography, the dialogue, this story with Paul and the fremen, arrakis, the acting was outstanding and for me it's a oscar worthy performance from Thimothée Chalamet. For me it's the best movie of the decade, if not the best movie of all time!!! The score is incredible, every sound effect makes the movie epic, and the score for me is one of the things that makes this movie so good aswell. If you like a world where they have their on language, where actors give it their all with a touching and epic story with loads of action and good dialogue, go watch it please!!",

Perfection is the only word I can use to accurately describe it. Truly a must-see in IMAX. From beginning to end this movie will pull you in and refuse to let go. Whether you are new to the world of Dune or experienced and well versed in the lore this movie is for you. The visuals are stunning, the sound fx are brilliant, the acting, superb. If this is what Hollywood is capable of doing then I will expect more masterpieces like this one in the future. \"The Spice must flow!",

    "Review Content": "As I said before Denis Villeneuve is literally the perfect director for this job:Likes of Incendies (2010), Arrival (2016), and many more projects crafted him more and more for a potential trilogy of Dune.And in here he goes even further with the themes of Fate, Free will, Coming of Age, Religion & Politics\nand how can all these can be exploited in the hands of someone which blossoms into his signature film.Maybe it's one of the reasons why it's so much universally loved right now as well, that it's not so much different from what we're going through.What is actually fascinating is story knows itself and doesn't make false promises. We can already see the glimpses of who Paul really is, or going to be...And, all the actors along with Timothée Chalamet deserves all the praises, all of the performances elevate each other.Production design and cinematography is great as always as well.All of these were contributed on this masterpiece of course and right now I can't wait for the Messiah.

    "Review Content": "Right out of the gate I want to state that I haven't read the brick of a book this is based on. In this instance however I feel you still can enjoy this fully.On the other hand I do have watched the original movie as well as the previous part, which I found visually appealing but in some regards almost a trailer to this second part. The original movie from 1984 is its own chapter, and quite frankly shouldn't be associated with these films. I won't dwell more into that one here other than state that it was a ghastly picture.With Denis Villeneuve once again at the helm I expected nothing more than a visual bombardment, which you indeed received. There was more of everything in this one, the visuals were truly spectacular. The score with grandmaster Hans Zimmer complemented the cinematography masterfully.The cast was mostly competent with Timothee Chalamet being the one improving most from the returning cast. Found him engaging showing more emotion and stepping up as a leader. The love interest with Zendaya also felt bearable to watch. Some questions arose about the cast though. The most obvious was the casting of Christopher Walken as the emperor. As I wrote I haven't read the book but I have a hard time contemplating that was they way a mighty character as him was portrayed. He felt weak in every sense. Dave Bautistas character was such a footnote in this they might as well have left him out. Haven't seen Austin Butler in much, he probably is a capable actor, but here and for me he wasn't intimidating in the least. Florence Pugh and Anya Taylor-Joy were criminally underused but I recon that will change in the final part if this trilogy.The story itself took a step forward in this part, it felt more fleshed out. The problem with pacing was regretfully still somehow present, especially towards the end. You still got a feeling this was an episode rather than a movie standing on its own.But, these drawbacks should be considered minor glitches in an otherwise brilliant production. In a time of so much mediocracy in movies this deserves praise for the level of execution. This is quality filmmaking well deserving of your time and if you haven't jumped aboard this yet you should.",

There are a lot of nuances in Dune that could have been brought out in the film if they had paced a little bit better. WHERE WAS ALIA? The way the screenplay was written, the expected you to believe that Paul had his meteoric rise to Messiah and they were somehow able to put a huge dent in spice production all in about 6-7 months? In the bookand in all other adaptations, it was clear that this happened over a long period of time. Maybe 3 -4 years, which made more sense. Missing that scene of a freakishly wise toddler stabbing her evil, fat grandfather in the neck really dampened my experience. #JusticeforStAliaoftheKnife.",

    "Review Content": "Dune Part II is a very good sequel. The world building in this movie is great and really establishes the Fremen culture. I love how the movie dives deep into how they view culture and religion and the split that they have over their belief in Paul. Timothee Chalamet is excellent as Paul Atreides. His character arc is amazing. He starts off as someone who just wants to help and then through his time with the Fremen he starts to use them and their faith to get his own revenge. Zendaya was also great and her character's dynamic with Paul was very fleshed out. I loved how she went from loving him to despising what he represents. Florence Pugh was a good addition here although she didn't have much to do. Austin Butler stole the show in my opinion. He was a perfect villain and his pure psychotic nature was frightening. The costumes, visual effects, and set design all looked great. I especially love the design of the black and white planet. There were a lot of cool things they did with it, like the fireworks for example. The action scenes are pretty good. The cinematography is very good and Denis Villeneuve crushed it directing. Hans Zimmer delivers a killer score here as he always does. I only have a few minor issues with the movie. Just like the first movie I think the pacing was a little off and despite Rebecca Ferguson giving a great performance I didn't really think her storyline was that interesting or well explained. Overall Dune Part II is a really good movie and if you liked the first one you'll have a great time here.",

    "Review Content": "LONG LIVE THE FIGHTERS!This film being a masterpiece is simply an understatement. It's practically perfect. I genuinely have not a single critique that I can think of. This is the best experience with a film I probably have ever had.I'm going to split this up into two parts, the first without spoilers and the second half will contain some pretty big spoilers that I need to address.Spoiler Free:Where do I even begin... from the very beginning scene you can tell this is going to be phenomenal. If you liked Dune 2021 at least a faint bit you will most likely love this. Everything from the first film is elevated tenfold. You can feel the amount of pure passion and love that Denis Villeneuve and the entire crew poured onto this behemoth of a project. Easily another Oscar sweep for Dune, this time it'll most likely win Best Picture because I can't fathom another film getting this close to perfection ever again or at least in the near future. Visually unexplainably beautiful. If you get the chance you need to watch it in IMAX or just the largest screen and loudest speakers you possibly can. The black and white Feyd-Rautha sequence is edited to unfathomable levels of perfection, hell that's just one of the scenes I can say that for. This movie has at least ten of the most bad-ass shots I've ever seen. Hans Zimmer's score is crafted with his usual mastery and is complimented so greatly by Greig Fraser's visuals in a beautiful tango of sight and sound.The conflicts our characters face are so intriguing and immersive, that we understand what they're going through, the dire decisions they have to make, and what it will cost them. The commentary on faith, purpose, and what is too far? It's so much more than a pretty sci-film movie with cool sounds, there is so much soul and so much to say and it executes every beat it wants to hit without fail. From giant epic battles to deep, personal, emotional, and quiet conversations it all blends as one beautiful portrait that is easily Denis Viellenueves Magnum Opus.The entire cast bodies every roll. Timothee Chalamet is the perfect Paul Atreides he handles his character with such power and gives off this Aura that I haven't seen in a very long time, may be the best character ever written that I've seen. If you don't care about this film at all that's okay, but please watch it to see his performance at least. Austin Butler's Feyd-Rautha is even more menacing than he is in the books and, again, is transformed into a performance I could see getting him another Oscar Nomination. Rebecca Ferguson's Lady Jessica has this presence that I can't even put into words. Zendaya's Chani has this beautiful chemistry with Chalamet's Paul Atreides with an irreplicable story between them so greatly displayed.I LOVED the costume design accompanied by some spectacular lighting that compliments each other in a way I haven't seen anything close to it.This is absolute Sci-Fi perfection. This is tied or even surpasses Empire as the best Sci-Fi film of all time and is the easiest top four I have ever put on this account, and it won't leave that's for sure. Every person who worked on this is a master at their craft and will be remembered throughout history as the people who put together potentially the greatest story ever told. I heard all the praise that this film got and knew after reading the book that it was going to be easily one of my favorites, but nothing could have prepared me for it to be as good as it was. Genuinely cannot think of a complaint. I commented on the first Dune how I wish there was an extended edition, not needed anymore. Denis Villeneuve couldn't have done better. He elevated the emotion and intensity of everything that happens in the novel with numerous additions to the source material while still being perfectly faithful. The only thing that saddens me is that Frank Herbert himself couldn't have watched this, I just know this is exactly what he wanted and what he deserved for his masterpiece of a novel.I can't express what this movie means to me, I'll be rewatching it over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. I've thrown around the phrase \"This is my Empire Strikes Back\" a few times like when I watched Endgame for example, but this is truly the only film that is deserving of that phrase. I'm so thankful I had the opportunity to see it all unfold in IMAX with a packed theater of pure Dune fans. It felt like home.LONG LIVE CINEMA.SPOILERS:\n..\n..\nTHEY GAVE GURNEY HIS BALISET!!!!! I genuinely got so excited that he got his few seconds with it. Denis' adaptation is so faithful to the source material while still having some insane creative liberties that for the first time (outside of his first Dune) just increases the quality.I LOVED what he did with Princess Irulan where we got to see her actually record the excerpts we read at the beginning of every chapter, such a great detail that lets us dive deeper into her character that barely makes an appearance in the actual book. Actually, Denis Villeneuve does a wonderful job of extending the appearances of all these characters that weren't in the novel in the first place. We get so much Rabban which makes me so happy, I was wishing we had gotten more of him in the first film because he's a pretty important character who we don't see much action from already in the book. So us being able to see him at his fullest during this was great. I can't even begin to talk about Feyd-Rautha... what a character, his presence is only matched by Muad'dib himself (who I will get to shortly). He's so menacing and evil... I love him. Getting to see him just slash people for simply questioning him was awesome and I'm so glad we got to see even more parallels between him and Muad'dib especially the added Gom Jabbar that I don't recall being a part of the novel, hell 90% of his scenes weren't in the novel but are all so in character and perfectly done that it's as if it was all a part of the original writing.Paul Atreides, Muad'dib, Usul, Kwisatz Harderach, Lisanal whatever you want to call him is easily one of the best characters ever put onto screen. I've said it already a few times, but the AURA that Chalamet brings to this character is something I can't put into words and is something that needs to be experienced. The shift in his character as we see him slowly accept his terrible purpose is so brilliantly displayed. The expressions in his eyes, the way he presents himself, all of it changes ever so slightly as we see him being The One. I remember after reading the book I revisited Dune 2021 and was lost on why they left out the revelation that the Baron is Lady Jessica's Father/ Paul's Grandfather. I remember thinking that this movie was gonna be half flashbacks because of scenarios like that and was slightly worried. I will never put an ounce of doubt on Villeneuve ever again. The way that it's revealed is so well done that it was another one of those moments where you'd think that it was written like that originally. Paul's conflict is so well displayed I loved seeing the really dark undertones that he was showing as the film progressed realizing that this war is a necessary thing to happen and no matter what that throne has to be taken. It's exactly what Frank Herbert would have wanted after he had to make an entire second book just because everyone thought Paul was a perfect hero, Denis handled that misconception perfectly and I can't wait for Dune Messiah (God please let it be greenlit) to see him fully handle the aftermath. That means I'm going to be reading Dune Messiah ASAP.I thought the choice of Alia not being born and no real mention of Leto II was very interesting but definitely didn't take anything away from the film. It definitely would be weird and difficult to have a four-year-old act like an all-knowing Bene Gesserit woman. I love how it also allowed for the chance of Paul killing the Baron himself which in my opinion was much more satisfying than Alia doing it. Speaking of satisfying death I loved how Gurney was the one who was able to kill Rabban after he mentioned that he killed his family as well as gave him the scar on his face much much more satisfying. Lady Jessica talking to Alia with her still in the womb I thought was really cool and perfectly displayed the connection the Bene Gesserit have with each other as well as a cool nod to the mother-daughter bond.Every battle (especially the final one) has so much raw emotion and strength with this scale that cannot be matched. I was grinning from ear to ear so much that I wish I had a camera set on me throughout the whole thing. The Atreides banner being waved on top of sandworms is one of the coolest things I'll ever see. The Feyd-Rautha birthday gladiator fight is one of the coolest things I'll ever see. The final battle between Muad'dib and Feyd-Rautha is one of the coolest things I'll ever see. The world-building as we dive further into Arrakis and Giedi Prime is one of the coolest things I'll ever see. The conflicts between Bene Gesserit, Fremen, Atreides, Harkonnen, Sardaukar, and Guild, is one of the coolest things I'll ever see.I could type for years, but I need to just let this soak for a bit, I'll be writing more with every watch of this I have.",

    "Review Content": "I am so so happy with how this film turned out. I love the Dune Books and I loved Part 1. But Part 1 was just a juicy appetiser to what is an extraordinary Part 2. This film is one of the best of the decade and maybe even of the century.To start with the obvious, the visuals, music and sound are top notch. This film is why people go to cinemas. The CG is flawless and at no point was my immersion broken. Hans Zimmer masterfully builds on his score from Part 1 with some truly great stuff. The cinematography is gorgeous and shows off Greg Fraiser's immense talent.The ensemble cast are all excellent, no bad performances are to be seen. Timothée Chalamet excels as Paul Atreides and he is excellent at playing the naive boy turned ruthless war general. Zendaya brings extra dimensions to Chani that arguably exceed the book version. In fact, The Fremen in general are more developed and diverse than in the book. Everyone gives it their all but the absolute standout is Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha. He is unrecognisable but does such an excellent job at giving the character great presence and charisma.There are deviations from the book, but they're all done well and are all done in service of a stronger, more streamlined and more digestible film overall. What's important is that the core themes of the book are perfectly intact within this film. The ideas are explored expertly and every moment feels well built and earned. While there are moments that may seem rushed, the book spends the exact same amount of time on them. Besides, the time is used well to develop characters.Overall, Dune Part 2 is nothing short of a masterpiece. It's everything a fan of the franchise could want. Like LoTR before it, it is a perfect adaption of its source material. This and part 1 make a complete package and they will likely go down in history as quintessential sci-fi classics and must-watch movies.",

Nearly every pivotal scene was apparently not written well enough by Frank Herbert and thus had to be (cough) improved on by some nameless hack for this on-screen abortion of one of the most seminal science fiction masterpieces of all time.If you love Dune watch the other version of this film, watch the TV adaptations, or better yet re-read the books.This film's only saving grace is that it would make a perfect way for an insomniac to finally get some sleep.",

Intoxicating. Galvanizing. Hair-raising. Heart-stopping. Awe-inspiring. Spine-tingling. Soul-stirring. These words alone couldn't describe the transcendence and otherworldly feeling you get experiencing this movie on the big screen on IMAX so do yourself a favor and book that ticket NOW.Hans Zimmer completely outdoes himself again with a captivating score that somehow not only rivals but surpasses his previous Oscar winner and Grammy nominated score from Dune Part One.Timothee Chalamet is an absolute star. His progression and development as Paul Atreides is so raw and captivating and I believe it's completely within reason to say that this movie cemented his status as one of the best actors of this next generation. Speaking of the best actors of this generation, Austin Butler was also a standout for his portrayal as the extremely menacing Feyd-Rautha. Notable performances also include the incredible Rebecca Ferguson, Zendaya, Josh Brolin, and Javier Bardem.Overall, this is simply an unforgettable experience and masterpiece of a movie that demands immediate indulgence. It was a visual feast that you will walk away from still digesting what in the world you just watched. You will be leaving full to your stomach and yet hungry enough to go back for seconds.

But the most important and my favorite part, the lore and story, were clouded in mist.

    "Review Content": "Dune Part 2\" stands as a testament to the heights cinematic art can reach when sound, acting, storytelling, and visuals converge in a harmonious spectacle. This sequel continues to unravel the intricate tapestry of Frank Herbert's universe, achieving a complexity in narrative that is both commendable and ambitious. The performances are, without a doubt, stellar. Each actor brings depth and nuance to their character, enriching the sprawling narrative that spans across desolate landscapes and fervent political intrigue.The sound design and score are, once again, unparalleled. They not only enhance the visual experience but also immerse the audience into the vast, sandy expanses of Arrakis and beyond. The visuals are nothing short of breathtaking. Each frame is a meticulously crafted piece of art, showcasing the alien beauty of Herbert's universe with an attention to detail that is rarely seen in cinema today.Despite these remarkable achievements, the film is not without its flaws. The narrative, while complex and engaging, is encumbered by the sheer weight of its own mythology. At a runtime of 2 hours and 45 minutes, the film occasionally feels lengthy, and its pacing suffers as a result. The story's grand scale and numerous subplots, though richly woven, sometimes lead to a narrative density that can be overwhelming. This is most evident towards the film's climax, where the rapid succession of dramatic events and crucial plot points can feel somewhat jarring, as if emerging from the ether rather than the story's natural progression.This pacing issue could have been mitigated with a more balanced approach, perhaps by trimming certain scenes or redistributing the narrative focus. This would allow for a more even tempo and give the audience time to digest the complex developments without detracting from the story's immersive quality.In summary, \"Dune Part 2\" is a film that dazzles with its visual and auditory spectacle, carried by powerful performances and a deep, intricate storyline. It is a worthy continuation of the saga that will surely satisfy fans and newcomers alike, despite its pacing issues and the daunting complexity of its mythology. It stands as a reminder of the power of science fiction to challenge, captivate, and transport its audience to worlds beyond their wildest imagination.",

    "Review Date": "2024-03-05",
    "Review Content": "I've read the books and watched the original 1984 film before these two remakes. They altered Chani's character arc (Zendaya), making her devotion to Paul Atreides clear but adding a condition to her love that he not change, only to have him change and betray her for political power after he transformed because of consuming the spice water. His transformation into both hero and villain was evident, especially in his choice of political power and the White Princess Irulan over Chani. Unfortunately, this depiction in Dune 2 felt like a slap in the face to her character as a woman of color, which I found disappointing.Furthermore, I also found the main storyline convoluted, the subplots irritating, and the ending unsatisfactory. In this iteration of the film, it could have been titled \"True Love, True Lies and the Thirst for Power\" due to its theme of betrayal, the lack of trustworthy characters and the idea that absolute power corrupts absolutely. Additionally, the underutilization of Austin Butler as Feyd Rautha was a missed opportunity, given the hype surrounding his role. It was little more than a cameo. And in case you haven't seen the original 1984 Dune film, all of those characters were well-developed and the storyline was well-written. Sting, in that film, was a much better Feyd Rautha because his version was fleshed-out. I also didn't like killing off Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa) in Part 1 and bringing back Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin) in Part 2. Momoa's Duncan Idaho would have made better sense since he was Paul Atreides mentor and teacher of the \"Weirding Way\" technique, in addition to being a brave soldier. It's worth noting that critics have praised the film, and it has garnered a significant following among movie-goers.I'm wondering did all of the people giving this film (9 and 10-star reviews) actually watch the same film as I did. Yes it was a beautiful spectacle in regards to the visuals, but how the film unfolded was confusing, the writing had no depth, the worms appeared to be an after-thought and what you're left with is more questions than answers. I simple liked Part 1 much better.",

The special effects were all very good but the setting and action just felt like a continuation of the last film (which of course it was) but it left me wanting more - despite the new characters. When it finished and the lights came up, everyone just sat there rather silent and it felt like we'd all been a bit lulled rather than having just watched something special. A shame as I've been looking forward to seeing this for ages.

This is an epic grand story that needs to be experienced on the biggest screen possible. From the visuals to the sound design, acting, story, this is truly the lord of the rings of this generation. This film focuses on the second half of the book which has all of the big war scenes and this film is honestly adapted a little more loosely from the book compared to the first part which I thought was brilliantly adapted. Zendaya really steals the show with her performance along with everybody else in this film. Even if you didn't like the first dune, trust me, you'll fall in love with this one.",

If it is a 3 part movie, it might be better to cover all the details and push the story to the climate. If you haven't watch part 1, watch it before watch part 2. If you like part 1, sure you will like part 2. Is not a traditional style of action of fantasy movie, is more like a cautionary tales that reflect real world religious and politics. Never the less, I would give it a 10 out of 10. Is a must watch movie in cinema, you won't get and same level of visual and audio effect at home. I recommend to watch the IMAX format.",

I went in with very high expectations and I am happy to say they were met. A very long movie, yes, but totally worth seeing. A much better adaptation than 1980 version in my eyes. The director managed to make the storyline more contemporarily relevant, and even though it is very dark and terrifying at times it portrays dangers of today's or any day's religious extreme fanatyzm very clearly.",

    "Review Content": "Again Villeneuve gives us a perfect visual masterpiece with added perfection in score, production design and special effects, plus impossibly epic set pieces and action sequences.But with all the groundwork done in part 1, the sequel meanders a bit too much with some things happening, but not a lot of things happening, which can make the movie a bit... slow at times. Let's just say slow.In particular, everything scene with Zendaya gets a bit boring and uneventful and she just doesn't do anything for me, giving the only bad and unnatural performance (in general, of course she has a couple of nice line deliveries here and there).Having said that, the greater actors and characters are the ones giving us the most thrilling scenes and intrigues. Ferguson and everything about the Bene Gesserit; Butler and Skarsgard and everything Harkonnen; Bardem and the Freemen culture. In the end, this type of movie deserves to be seen on a Cinema, regardless of how close to perfect it is or not.",

    "Review Content": "I doubt I'm alone in feeling that part one was great but ended right when it was about to leave the chain. Part two broke it and ran. I personally love it when the setting feels like a character in the movie and the desert is that in this one. Timothy Chalamet gives a performance beyond his young age. Zendaya does well and has a much larger part to play here. The direction by Denis is almost flawless and some shots are pure art.Not much to say on the negative side. The third act feels rushed quite a bit. Act one and two move along at the same pace as all of part one, then it feels like the end is forced like someone was looking over his shoulder to finish up. This is a grand movie with a grand scope from grand source material and it shows.What a massive undertaking. It must be so hard to film in a desert, with sand gumming up the technology but you'd never know by watching Dune. It just feels like you are there with them all. Great job!

    "Review Content": "Dune: Part Two - A Review (Spoiler-Free)Here's a spoiler-free review of Dune: Part Two:Visually Stunning: The film continues the breathtaking visuals from Part One, immersing audiences in the vast landscapes of Arrakis and the grandeur of its cultures. Director Denis Villeneuve's vision shines through, creating a visually stunning experience.Deeper Exploration: Part Two delves deeper into the complex world of Dune, exploring the Fremen culture and their struggles against the oppressive Harkonnens. It also delves further into Paul Atreides' journey and the burdens of his potential future.Stronger Focus on Characters: The relationships between characters, particularly Paul and Chani, are given more focus in this film. The performances, especially from Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya, are powerful and captivating.Action-Packed Sequences: While not an action-heavy film, Part Two delivers intense and well-choreographed action sequences, particularly when the Fremen face off against their enemies.Not a Standalone Film: It's important to note that Part Two is the second half of a larger story. While it builds on the first film and offers a satisfying conclusion to its specific arc, it also sets the stage for a potential third film.Overall: Dune: Part Two is a visually stunning and narratively engaging film that builds upon the foundation laid by Part One. It offers a deeper exploration of the characters and world while delivering both action and emotional resonance. However, viewers unfamiliar with the first film or the source material might find it challenging to fully grasp the complexities of the story.",

    "Review Content": "Let me get things straight, this is not sci-fi by any means. It's a fantasy driven story with sci-fi elements sprinkled throughout. A sci-fi story is driven by consistency, here supernatural elements drive the story.It's played well enough, filmed well enough, long and boring at times and doesn't escape the inconsistencies of the book.We have the one, I mean another \"the one\" (TM, C, rehashed through and through) who, despite being built like a twig, manage to overcome anything placed in front of him (morpheus recognizes easily that he is the One and is ready to give his life for Zion). We have fremens, with some women built also like twigs who engage in fights with much bigger men while others cower in fear (how does this society work exactly?). In a time of space lasers shown prominently in the first scene of the first movie, everyone loves blades in this one unless they want nukes which miraculously have been hidden on the planet for time immemorial, really? And no one wondered why the nukes just happen to be relocated from their homeworld to this one and everyone forgot about them? The south storm business is funny for sure: don't think about it, just enjoy the spectacle.There's also sandworms who behave as intended for the plot to move forward. Actually, lots of things just happen for the plot to move forward, even if it means that the characters have to behave inconsistently from a scene to the next.Speaking of the sandworms, and that's something that the filmmaker avoided at all cost, was to show how the riders dismounted the beasts because it made no sense whatsoever. The filmmaker kept the riding sequence because it's impressive: these are monsters eating sand and machinery for breakfast, rubbing themselves on rocks anytime of the day, and they are bothered by (and then driven like cattle), in comparison with their size, by what is like two pieces of dust on top of their skin?They can also capture baby sandworms but not perform basic biochemistry or chemistry to synthesize/farm spice at will? (I know the book was written in the 60s and biotechnology was not as developped, although penicilin was manufactured by fermentation already in WW2).The messianic and religious aspects are exhausting to the point where I started to root for the antagonists towards the end because the protagonists have literally no redeeming qualities.It's a spectacle to enjoy for sure, but don't pay attention to the story, it's nonsensical.",

    "Review Content": "It would be a mistake to attempt to cram the entire story of Dune into a single movie, even if that movie were three-hours long. Having read Frank Herbert's Dune hexalogy, I have confidence that Denis Villeneuve could continue on and make entertaining interpretations of both Dune Messiah and Children of Dune. What I really, really, really can't wait to see, of course, and I think we can all agree on this critical point, is what would Timothée Chalamet look like when we get to God Emperor of Dune and he has become a giant, um, well, just look at some of the paperback covers.Dune: Part Two is a visual feast and smörgåsbord. Even the dunes look pretty. The massive crowds at Arrakeen are a bit whatever, the on-screen chemistry between Chani and Paul is reminiscent of Anakin and Padmé tossing each other cringe-tastic love lines, the pace plods along slower than a spice harvester until the last 30 minutes, and Paul's transformation is not rizz.But Rebecca Ferguson is great, as is Javier Bardem and Christopher Walken. Dune: Part Two does a far better job of depicting plot movements than Dune: Part One, and also a decent job explaining how the different political factions are perpetually conniving and angling for more power, more spice.There are a handful of differences between the novel and Dune: Part Two, which I suppose were made for logical reasons. Please, Denis, don't change anything, any thing at all, if you make a movie version of God Emperor of Dune.",

Thank you for making this and introducing me to the world of Dune.I think as someone who had not read the book but then was so intrigue by the world after the first Dune movie and started reading and watching the summary of the book, the premonitions of it all was so good.The movie was intense, helped by the amazing soundtrack and sound design. I think it truly should win some award for the sound design.The cinematography is beautiful and oh my freaking god... the set design... the brutalism architecture paired with this harsh environment and also this interior design. It does remind me a lot of ai art, especially looking at the harkonnes interior, but I still love it. I am weak to brutalism and just amazing harsh line. I do think blade runner has more interesting interior but this one is also amazingly done. Spacious and just so powerful and huge.Timothee is amazing.. to think he was casted as Wonka and now to this movie. A reminiscence of his role in the King. Vulnerability but then all commanding. A formidable presence. I am looking forward to all of his future roles.Javier Bardam... bringing in the believer. Zendaya a powerful presence too. Perfectly casted as Chani who has her own character and stature. Florence Pugh... love the costume.Rebecca Fergusson... commanding. Love her always. And the surprising appearance by lea sedoux... sexy as always. Josh brolin... and many others. Do say seeing anna taylor johnson took me out of the movie a little bit.But yeah...

    "Review Content": "I believe that part 2 surpasses part 1 in terms of beauty, even though part 1 was already quite stunning. In part 2, the divergence from the books is more pronounced for obvious sequel reasons, which led to choices different from what I would have preferred (no spoilers here).Due to these editorial decisions, some iconic quotes from the original material are missing in this adaptation (like \"My brother is coming\").Despite the teasing for the sequel, I still find Lynch's or the HBO miniseries' versions more compelling in terms of storytelling. However, nothing can compare to the visual and auditory spectacle that Dune parts 1 and 2 present.Lynch's adaptation took liberties, such as introducing the sound weapon, but it maintained a closer adherence to the overall storyline and atmosphere of the books. Perhaps my nostalgia plays a role here, as I first experienced it in the theatre upon its release.Some scenes require a certain level of visceral (yet functional) gore to remain faithful to the story, and Villeneuve's version seems to lack that element.",

'Dune: Part Two' is excellent! My interest did wane slightly at roughly the middle part, as was similarly the case with the first film in truth, but that was a feeling that only lasted for a relativiely short time.All in all, it's fantastic. The acting is top notch, the visuals are breathtaking (those sandworms tho) and the score is outstandingly hefty - you can always rely on the great Hans Zimmer! Timothée Chalamet stars yet again, as do the likes of Rebecca Ferguson, Zendaya, Dave Bautista & Co. The person I actually enjoyed most on screen was Javier Bardem, who is truly brilliant throughout.Bring on 'Dune Messiah'!

    "Review Content": "The first Dune movie I had mixed feelings, since it felt too much like setting up pieces rather than a satisfactory story. Even if you're building a trilogy every movie should stand on it's own feet. Without ever having read the books I understand now why it is so difficult to capture them on film. Although we get a lot of story to chew here, certain characters feel still underdeveloped. To be fair I liked Part Two much more since we finally get some pay-offs from the first part. But then in the last act we get the same clunky set-ups we got in part one unfortunately. I must stress out that I enjoyed the movie quite a bit and I urge anybody to see it in cinema because it is an achievement and a sight to behold. Dennis Villeneuve and his team are masters at their craft: cinematography, editing, production design, sound & music are performing on the highest level here. It's truly rare to see this kind of united quality on a big screen, and it deserves to be up in the ranks of the biggest blockbusters. Everybody who loves going to the cinema to be immersed in another time and space should check it out. I might watch it again, just because I enjoyed it purely on a visceral level. The movie is almost three hours long but it passes by much quicker due to the great narrative flow. What I had problems with, although sounding nitpicky, is that there are so many players, that we don't get to know them very well and some important ones are dispatched of too quickly, sort of anti-climatic. Especially the ending felt kind of rushed to me. In general, but especially in the final battle I expected more losses or opposition in the fight. It almost felt too easy, no struggle. Again, this would have been great as a mini series, especially when it comes to fleshing out the antagonists. But on the other hand Vileneuve would have not gotten the budget for the location shoots, cinematography, sfx and everything else that made this so impressive if he had to operate on a streaming budget. I wished Villeneuve would release all the deleted scenes (of there are any) of this and turn it retroactively into a mini series, but since we all know his stance towards deleted scenes we know this is not going to happen. As it stands, I still enjoyed the hell out of this movie. It should be seen not only because of the immersive world and ambitious storytelling. But also to signal the big studios that audiences are tired of spectacle movies. And that they need to get their story departments in check, try to win audiences back with compelling stories rather than dangling shiny things in front of kittens.",

    "Review Content": "Ruin 2\nI suspect will be no better than Ruin One. Unfortunately image entertainment has so permeated our society/world that radio news, newspapers, and magazines more often than not imitate it, and spend a lotta space on it. Network television, and much other image entertainment, is a propaganda machine of such proportions it would have Goebbels frothing at the mouth. Still, it is something we can avoid. We do not live by our images, but by our words. For example, we do not say, \"You can count on his image,\" or \"He gave his image,\" or \"Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every image that proceeds from the mouth of God.\" This is why whenever substantial and important issues are televised it's just people talking. Nevertheless, television and image entertainment are so pervasiveness and predominant that they project the illusion that image is more important and what we live by. The only way to counter this is to not view it. And talk to each other, and I mean face to face. Television and other image entertainment, by the technology inherent to it, can only give an image of what is happening in the world. On top of that, we need a cogent and rational thought base to interpret the images we do see, thereby proving we can do without these kind of images.Making movies is hard work, just the logistics of settings, scenes, wardrobe, and getting everyone to show up at the times to get things done, as well as feeding and housing them, is a lotta hard work; so is hot tar roofing, although prolly a lot easier these days. Yet, you don't need to see a movie, but fixing a leak in a roof . . . . You don't need to see a movie, but how's about digging some canals to reservoirs to cache alladat Sierra Nevada snow melt with just somada monies wasted on films, and the, 'We're so good and talented' award shows; I'd watch a doc about that. Essentially film has no intrinsic value; the value comes when people are enticed or convinced they ought to view a film. However, I would bet most people watch movies because they've nothing else to do, they are bored, they hope to get some emotional response, they view it as a 'friend,' or they have developed a habit. The wildly numerous availability of films calls to mind the sci-fi story of a national government lottery wherein the winner received the prize of parenteral nutrition, flotation tank life, and eyelid removal to they could view movies twenty-four seven. At least now one can know they are not living in the Matrix for the movies would be better, and that certainly includes every Dune flick over the years; the books are just not convertible to good film. Whereas Herbert's 'Hellstrom's Hive' is.Gower Street Analytics estimates North American box office 30% below the 2017-2019 average, and I don't think that can be blamed much on the Hollywood strikes or the scamdemic. Many people are thinking I'll wait for it to show up at a library, for it's just not worth the time or effort to go to a theater. Apparently I can see Ruin for $6 at the closest theater forty miles away. In CA it's $15>. The last time I took my sister in Santa Barbara to flick, years ago, it was about a $100 night, not including supper.Now I'm not saying movies are not worth the effort, just most of them. There are a few flicks where I just sat and watched it again, I'm sure you can't do that today. \"All That Jazz,\" \"Moonstruck,\" and \"Lord of the Rings ROTK.\" Usually you just chew that stick of gum once and throw it out, but here's a few that I watch every now and then: \"The Best Years of Our Lives (IMHO maybe best movie ever),\" \"Hell In The Pacific,\" \"Love Affair (1939 none of the remakes or variations, and in the PD),\" \"One, Two, Three,\" \"Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon,\" and \"The Cowboys.",

After all those plans, who could believe that such an emperor was behind them.

    "Review Date": "2024-03-01",
    "Review Content": "Beginning where Part One ended, the second part of Dune arrives and met my expectations, it's as big and impressive as its predecessor, full of spectacles. What Dune: Part One accomplished and established, Part Two enhances every corner and creates an even fully realized world and universe which makes you want to see more of it. Denis Villeneuve and the work by cinematographer Greig Fraser and production designer Patrice Vermett, it's together and their work which makes the brilliance which ended up on the big screen. Again, Denis Villeneuve and Greig Fraser create some truly stunning and spectacular shots, with Villeneuve making the best use of his mise-en-scene which he so often does. Denis Villeneuve co-wrote the screenplay with Jon Spaihts and served as a producer. Dune: Part Two is cinema, having some of the finest writing and direction but also aesthetics. It's a film like no other.Paul Atreides unites with Chani and the Fremen while seeking revenge against the conspirators who destroyed his family.Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin, Stellan Skarsgård, Dave Bautista, Zendaya, Charlotte Rampling, and Javier Bardem reprise their roles from the first film, with Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, Florence Pugh as Princess Irulan, Christopher Walken as Shaddam IV the Padishah Emperor of the Known Universe and head of House Corrino, and Léa Seydoux as Lady Margot Fenring joining the ensemble cast. To name a few great performances, I would have to say Rebecca Ferguson and Timothée Chalamet along with Zendaya with Javier Bardem shining the most with his charismatic performance, in the new cast it was Austin Butler and Florence Pugh. Austin Butler was terrific in the role but should have been in more scenes to make him into a more three dimensional character which I expected from the film. Another new actor is Christopher Walken and although I really like him as an actor, he wasn't right for this role, but it's such a small (but important) role that it was easy for me to look past. Walken portrays the arrogance perfectly though. There were just too few scenes of these new characters, people who we didn't really get to know, except for Florence Pugh's character who through narration and plenty of scenes which makes us get to know her. The film would have been better if it were longer, perhaps 15 minutes longer.The showdown between Paul Atreides and Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen in what is the final fight/action sequence in the film, it met my expectations. The fight was well choreographed and was shot perfectly, using the silence to make us hear every hit and build up the tension even more. Dune focuses on spectacle and big epic scenes that have a huge amount of suspense and tension in them, you sit on the edge of your seat multiple times. The narrative focuses on the relationship between Paul and Chani, something we saw in the dreams in Part One, in this film we get to see that play out and although their chemistry isn't the best, it's still believable and a big reason I believe people criticize the chemistry is because of Chani not having the same beliefs and also of being her own person who have doubts on Paul and other things, the two had just met after all. Regarding Paul Atreides and his character arc throughout the film, being Lisan al Gaib (the Messiah), he's scared of his visions and what that'll bring. His character arc goes with Chani's own as well. This is one of those chosen one stories that have such depth and make this formula fresh again, which it was when Dune was released (1965). Back to another sequence, the gladiator scene which is also the big introduction scene of the new antagonist and nephew to the Baron. Villeneuve and cinematographer Greig Fraser had filmed Feyd-Rautha's gladiator sequence in black-and-white by mixing monochrome with color photography, making it a strange yet mesmerizing sequence which has you in awe. It contributes to the aesthetics.About the film's aesthetics and costumes, Erik Kain of Forbes wrote this, \"The film's aesthetic is superb and distinct and feels more fleshed out than the first film-from the Bene Gesserit in their veils to the masked bodyguards in the arena with Feyd-Rautha. Costume and set design goes above and beyond, giving us a fully realized, wholly unique and immersive sense of place throughout the film, whether in the deserts of Arrakis or the green gardens of the Padishah Emperor.\" I agree fully with this. This film looks absolutely gorgeous and along with the beautiful cinematography, the aesthetics are the major component which makes it such a gorgeous motion picture. Denis Villeneuve captures cinema masterfully with using dialogue sparsely and choosing instead to use the shots set up and photographed, that's what's interesting with cinema and photography, how a picture/frame can say more than words ever could. There were a few scenes which could have had less dialogue, which makes his comments here not that positive but then again, I understand him. \"Frankly, I hate dialogue,\" the filmmaker told The Times of London in a recent interview. \"Dialogue is for theatre and television. I don't remember movies because of a good line, I remember movies because of a strong image. I'm not interested in dialogue at all. Pure image and sound, that is the power of cinema, but it is something not obvious when you watch movies today.\" like I said, I understand him, image and sound is extremely important. Again, those things are two highlights. The sound design and musical score is spectacular and seeing it in the cinema only enhances it with music and explosions among other things like the sand worms, it was loud and you felt it all around you, Dolby Atmos was just superb and needed for the experience Dune has to offer. Hans Zimmer's musical score is once again a big highlight. To another critic's thoughts, Peter Bradshaw for The Guardian, awarded the film four stars out of five, writing \"Denis Villeneuve's monumental adaptation expands its extraordinary world of shimmering strangeness. It's impossible to imagine anyone doing it better.\" No one could have done a better Dune film, perhaps David Lynch would have been close if he got to do the film he wanted and not being restricted. Denis Villeneuve's Dune (both parts) is a masterpiece.I was completely mesmerized when I left the cinema, now a day after, having time to reflect on this massive and epic movie, a film I completely love. Yet, I liked Part One more. Saying that, you'll have to understand how I rate this film, technically and everything Denis Villeneuve and his crew contributed to the film, what the actors did with their well written characters. This film is perfect in lots of ways and met all my high expectations. Something else worth noting is how the film clearly sets up a third film, based on Dune: Messiah (second book), which Denis Villeneuve has said he's interested in adapting. There's one criticism I got though, how the timeline is quite too fast paced with months feeling like weeks, I would have wanted the film to be longer and the second half to be paced slower. I expected more of a war in the second half, things I wished to see happen off screen. More politics and intrigue was needed as well. Yet, I loved every second of the film, my rating is perhaps 9.5 but it's a great followup which focuses on the Messiah and religious aspects, leaning into themes of power and fanaticism.",

    "Review Content": "I had big expectations for part one. I was quite disappointed. After the whole marketing and hype I thought part two must be better. I like the work of Villeneuve, and I wanted to like this, but there is so much nonsense about everything! Taming and riding ridicously huge monsters just by holding two \"anchors\" describe the dimension of this pseudo fantasy quite well. I felt sick after over two hours of extreme close ups in IMAX. It was so much visions and dreams and profecies. Not even the showdown was a real one. Not really a big battle, only the word \"grandfather\". The acting of Bautista, Buttler, Bardem and Zendaya was painful to me. Those were long, tedious 150 minutes for me. 9 on the IMDB? How is it possible?",

    "Review Content": "POSITIVES:1) The performances are almost all great. Timothee Chalamet really carries the film with the amount of screen time he has and I really thought he was sensational in portraying Paul's turn to the darkness, as were the vast majority of the supporting cast\n2) The size and scale of this film are truly remarkable. You should see this film on the biggest screen you can with the best sound system you can. Denis deserves a lot of credit for holding the reins here and delivering a film that is not only grand in scale but also grand in terms of its themes and messages. Whether it's the huge epic battle sequences we see, or the intense hand to hand combat scenes with Feyd, the film was gripping in all its action scenes\n3) Hans Zimmer truly brings his A game and the score for this film will be hard to beat when the Oscars come back around next year. He is an epic composer and this is a truly epic musical achievement\n4) For a film only just under three hours long, I thought it flew over. I checked my watch once just in passing and couldn't believe that 2 hours had passed already, which is a great sign because usually I say that films should be shorterNEGATIVES:1) I mentioned that I thought the performances were \"almost all\" great. The one exception to that for me was Dave Bautista. I really like him as an actor and usually think he performs great, but here I just felt that the performance was very one dimensional. I'm pretty sure he yells every single line of dialogue he has and it just got irritating after a while\n2) The first hour of the film was a bit of a slog for me, because it focuses almost exclusively on just meandering around with the Fremen. In fact, I found the Fremen sections of the film to be by far the weakest part. Whenever the Harkonnens or the Bene Gesserit were on screen I was loving it, but the scenes exploring Fremen culture and their religious beliefs were just a bit unnecessary for me because there are soooo many of them. Lady Jessica becomes Reverend Mother almost instantly and all the stuff about Stillgar being convinced Paul is their saviour even when he says he's not was almost comical at times and has already been made the focus of several memes online.",

Some twists and turns to keep you on your toes and an epic final battle wild enough to capture the attention of even the most stoic.Dune Part Two delivers on a level most won't expect it to, and thats the most enjoyable part.

The rest of the cast; look tired not that not entertained. Suprising because many of them are really good actors in other movies.The other good thing is that it looks like there will be DUNE THIRD PART which was only made in cheap serial and perhpas is most interesting; but I really doubt it will be short as the seriesIn bief; save time and see the original.",

The epic soundtrack by Hans Zimmer perfectly complements the cinematic experience, contributing to the grand atmosphere of the film.Denis Villeneuve demonstrates technical competence, reaching a level of excellence in the cinematic field. For science fiction enthusiasts, the film is an excellent piece to fill their time.However, my main criticism centers on the complex narrative, rich in details and characters, making it challenging for those unfamiliar with the Dune universe. Despite being initially engaging, the plot became confusing amidst intrigues and actions, leaving me lost. The final part of the film raised questions about the characters' motivations, hindering the clarity of the story.The nearly three-hour duration felt rushed in some scenes, reminiscent of the last season of \"Game of Thrones,\" where resolutions were quick, lacking time for reflection. Perhaps a slower approach, possibly divided into two parts, would have benefited the narrative.The character development was disappointing, as I couldn't establish emotional connections with them. Their fate became indifferent, and only Chani managed to evoke a slight emotional bond.The villains, especially Feyd-Rautha, seemed to have potential but were not portrayed as true threats. The treatment they received was considered inadequate, impacting the construction of the antagonism.",

    "Review Content": "I've just come out of the movie theater. I had adjusted my expectations in advance so that I could have lived with it if \"Dune - Part 2\" had been like Part 1, with its strengths and weaknesses. In this respect, Part 2 completely disappointed my expectations... for the absolute better!In my opinion, Dune - Part 2 makes up for every weakness of its predecessor(without spoilers):Part 2 has a much better pacing and has the perfect narrative tempo. Not too fast-paced and rushed, but also not as lengthy and tough as part 1. In addition, I wasn't bored for a minute of the 166 minutes.Part 2 offers much more emotional depth in terms of the plot and the characters. I actually empathized a lot with the characters here. The feelings I had throughout the movie ranged from happiness, tension, joy, worry, fear, indignation to hope and satisfaction. Great!Part 2 has much better background music than Part 1, where I wasn't always entirely satisfied with the soundtrack. Here, however, Hans Zimmer has once again demonstrated absolute class, almost on a par with Blade Runner: 2049 or Interstellar!Part 2 contains significantly more subtext and hidden or clear and obvious messages. There is a lot to think about in the plot and dialog.The amount of action has increased significantly, but not so much that you could call it a constant barrage of action. The action scenes that can be seen are absolutely superbly staged and perfectly mixed in terms of sound. A great soundscape with a great surround backdrop. The camera work and various shots are also great. You can always follow the action scenes wonderfully and have some great perspectives that ensure that the viewer always has an overview of the action.Overall, the visual presentation is much more varied and elegant than in its predecessor. The desert of Arrakis has also been depicted much better and more authentically.In Part 2, the actors/actresses have significantly more opportunities to breathe life into their characters, which makes them much more tangible and authentic.Overall, I am absolutely thrilled with this sequel, which really puts Part 1 in the shade in all respects. My current rating shows me that I rated Part 1 too highly after all. \"Dune - Part 1\" would now only be a 7/10 for me.With Dune - Part 2, Denis Villeneuve has truly created another masterpiece. Dune - Messiah can come!Rating: 9/10 points\nRe-watch value: High\nLasting impression : High\nEmotional depth: High.",

Similarly, the first film had a mostly philosophical background, while the second was more action-packed and more exciting for the audience who didn't read the books.I can understand why the changes were made, even though I was a little annoyed by the parts that were interpreted differently from the book (it would not be easy to portray a child who could kill an adult soldier with a dagger at the age of 3).Pros:\nThe movie had great action scenes, creative and \"cyberpunk\" warship designs and was mostly loyal to books.Cons:\nI wish I could feel the difficulty of experiencing the all the past ( and future) visions after drinking \"ab-i hayat\" water of life. Normally, it gives Paul a huge pain in the books: to speak each and every ancestors of himself including his deceased father. It is like a thousand sound in your head at the same time and this can make someone getting mad if you are not strong enough.Lastly, I am still in the curiosity of how they will deal with \"3000 years\" time lapse between 2. And 3. Books. (It will be between 3. And 4. Movies)",

Everyone is good, really, really quite brilliant. Austin Butler must of had such fun with his role as he goes all out and is totally unrecognizable from real life. I could go on about everyone else, but that is not needed,This part has a lot more action going for it since most of the cast we are familiar with, but still there is lots of good conversing, humour is nicely put in that helps the mood.

Part 1 is an excellent example on how to worldbuild while giving the audiences time to immerse the story in their minds, but part 2 feels like the story is going from arc to arc because the studio only have a budget for a two-parter movie shot back-to-back, it's just kinda hard to focus on and almost leaves no room for build-ups.

I mean, I do think this is a pretty great movie but only as good as the first part. While it does some things in the narrative more focused, that's mostly because those were just getting set up in the first part. The pacing is pretty off here and the way most of the action scenes are not really given more importance than simple narrative formula, it still felt unfinished at the end. It didn't really use the villains much either as it was all set-ups that felt anti-climatic. But even with all those problems, it was still effective in showcasing the evil that can rise from fundamentalism. The way Javier Bardem's lines were funny throughout the movie is also a reminder of how evil can spread through righteousness and earnestness when you are forced to be blinded by indoctrination that uses their rightful hatred. I really do hope the next part Messiah is still made, since this still feels very unfinished.",

This kid Thimotee, or whatever his name is, is not up to the task of being the sci-fi Muhammed of the dunes, lacks charisma, acting skills and age. The guy looks like a teen, give him high school films to act in. I almost fell a sleep 2 times in the cinema, and it was a 1pm showing, so i wasn't tired or anything. There were some unexplained obvious plot holes which slapped my face directly and just left me dumbfounded.I'm a sci-fi fan, so I was entertained enough, but I wouldn't give this thing a second watch, its very superficial.Everything visual is a 10/10, audio is a 5/10 (pls stop using Zimmer for every blockbuster omg, all his music sounds the same and its horribly simple melodies with dramatic crescendos for the most basic scenes sometimes). Costumes are...well, the bene gesserit look awesome, everything else can be made out of homeless fashion.To me, the Javier Barden character was literally the most important one, yet they gave him almost no time to develop whatsoever. He is the guy who hyped Paul Artreides up, without him Paul would never be an important figure at all.The director was all about epic show, and almost nothing about psychological substance and character development - which are crucial to connect the audience with the story.

However, despite having everything that made the first film a masterpiece, it's not as impressive as the first film.There's nothing to say about the cinematography and visuals; coupled with Zimmer's magnificent scores, it rivets you to your seat.It's not quite possible to say the same thing for some of the performances. Especially, the casting choices for the emperor and his daughter raise some questions.Christopher Walken portrays himself, and Florence Pugh isn't convincing. It's no wonder the Baron wants to overthrow this incompetent emperor!The seduction of Feyd-Rautha, having more screen time than Paul's training and ascension to prophet status, is just one of the storytelling issues.While Zimmer's music remains fantastic, it's slightly behind his Oscar-winning work in the first film. In the initial movie, the music was intricately woven into the planet and the entire story in a much more organic manner, which was definitely on a different level.Be sure to watch this film in theaters; it's definitely one of the few movies worth seeing on the big screen this year.",

    "Review Content": "Not since Lord of the Rings have I been so enthralled by a movie I couldn't wait until I was able to review it.The acting, the story telling, the scenery, the philosophies and human nature. It's so encapsulating I was catching myself being so immersed I forgot I was watching a movie.The continuation of Paul Atreides' story happens at a perfect pace. New characters are introduced in a way that makes you care just enough about them to make it impactful. The telling of the stories of the Bene Gesserit is done masterfully, conveying stuff from the book that is hard to put on screen.If there was one thing I was missing, it's the use of the word \"holy war\" instead of the book accurate \"Holy Jihad\". But I suppose that's just something they have to change.This is a 10 out of 10 if there ever was one.",

    "Review Content": "Denis Villeneuve has set a new standard for how Sci Fi movies should be adapted and directed. There are few things to nitpick. Mostly to do with timeline and character transition. But when you understand it is being adapted to screen, it is near impossible to show a timeline which happens over few years. The art design, cinematography, vfx will set new gold standards. The cast and acting was stellar with a sprinkle of humour from Javier Bardem. Austin Butler, Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken all were stellar as the new characters. Caught it at the Sunday Fan First Premiere. Going for a 2nd showing on March 1st at IMAX 70MM.",

    "Review Content": "There are changes from the book, which is fine, but it results in plot holes. The changes to the characters of Stilgar and Chani, both portrayed by great actors, left them with less depth. Stilgar is shown as more of a true believer than a lieutenant, and the complexity of the character in the book is that he is both. Likewise Chani loses depth by becoming more of a 'girlfriend' and less the visionary future mother of a god-emperor. Villeneuve overused made up languages, whose limited use I enjoyed in Part One, but found distracting here. The black-and-white color palette of Giedi Prime lost an opportunity to depict the industrial world in richer but unhealthy hues, perhaps stressing reds and purples as well as white and black, and avoiding greens, blues, and browns. Mere black and white made it seem less real than the brutal planet ruled by psychopaths depicted in the books. Great looking worms, desert landscapes, and special effects, moving music. I missed the role of the sister, the navigators, and the mentats, all central to the plot.",

But most great things about the movie are credited to the book aka the plot, lore, setting, characters, politics etc. The \"filmmaking\" part of it beside Cinematography was mediocre to good at best. The emotion range and Believability of characters for example, every single character had one single role in this movie, no depth, complexity or character development. The dramatic scenes were extremely bad, why would shani look at the screen giving her back to the enemies during a WAR!!Disappointed, but still enjoyed it.....",

Cinematic is great, the machinery and weapons are something different thatn in other movies.There are characters that worth exploit more, like Irulan for example.Sardaukars are children in this part, Rabban was, somehow, different than I imagine.

    "Review Content": "As a Sci-Fi freak I was enthralled by the first Dune movie. Looking back now that was child's play compared to what Denis Villeneuve created with Part 1 and now Part 2. His understanding of Frank Herbert's spiritual underpinnings are taken to a level of such mastery it is dumbfounding. So many moments you just are blown away with the cinematic experience, music, acting and scale of grandeur. With so much anticipation I walked away not only proud but eager now for Dune Heretics or God.The world of Harconan's was out of this world. The fierce gladiator scene, black fireworks ( So cool), the fact he was the grandson of the Baron? Lordy I don't remember that from the book (was that artistic license?). The amazing no MIND BLOWING scenes of exploding spice machines, and by far the best visual was riding the worms. So cool from side angle - then again from above! Awesome...Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya are magical onscreen together. There is a scene when they fall in love and their acting of being in love was there. Zendaya has done an amazing job in her young acting career. As the movie drew to its conclusion her pouty portrayal was almost too easy to get away with. But Chalamet was brilliant. On another level the ending was a bit of a disappointment. The reality of what was about to occur would have been wonderful to see or experience. That first Dune did a better job. But the religious fervor went beyond what I ever dreamed and it worked perfectly.Javier Bardem was so perfectly well cast as the true believer. He will get an Academy Award in 2025 for his performance- truly epic. I also enjoyed how Villeneuve wove in the dialogue with the unborn child of Rebecca Furguson... again a chose I wasn't expecting. The final thing that l enjoyed was the details and mood set by costumes. Again Brilliant is my only adjective..... go see it because I will at least once or twice more this week. Totally rocked my world (or galaxy).On a somber side - I missed the worms coming up to greet the great Paul Moadhib... the scene with him drinking the water of life from the worm (blue cool), was a lost opportunity for a really amazing scene. But the Director seems to have wanted to keep it less about savior Paul but reluctant God. So the scene with Zendaya's tears wasn't really all that interesting or gripping. That scene and the lack of closure? What about the waves on Dune? What about him saying to the witches \"there is a place inside the water of life that you can't look at - because it is I who is standing there\"... again artistically not my fav choice. But OMG the Best Sci-Fi ever! Awesome thanks !",

People dodging highly powerful gun shooting too?Did you know that the King has new clothes?The background running theme music often overpowered the dialogue.Perhaps a summary from the first episode would have helped me to understand the story line and I even bared the first remake film.The main character wanted to go North, or was it South, to go alone, yet he was never alone?My recommendation is give it a miss, it's overly hyped.",

    "Review Title": "Visual masterpiece that lacks soul",
    "Review Date": "2024-03-02",
    "Review Content": "Well, this really was a breathe of fresh air.In ocean of big, dumb, driven with awful CGI blockbusters that polluted the cinema over the last few years, it's pleasing to finally see something that's appealing to both eyes and ears. In visual department, \"Dune 2\" outdoes it's predecessor in every way (and that movie was already one of the most gorgeous movies ever made). The worms, the action scenes and the world of \"Dune\" feel grand without feeling overbearing and are accompanied by equally epic soundtrack. Villeneuve, Zimmer and whole visual department deserve infinite credit for their work here.Then there are performances. Timothy Chalamet completely destroyed my doubts by delivering a powerful performance as Paul the leader. This is definitely the guy that I would follow into the battle. Bardem and Fergusson are also excellent in their respective roles (although latter doesn't get nearly enough screen time that she should). Brolin doesn't appear much in the movie but he's still entertaining as always.Unfortunately, not all performances are great. Poor Zendaya really tries her best here, but it just doesn't work. She and Timothy have no chemistry and her acting just looks unnatural.Contrary to popular opinion, I absolutely dislike portrayal of Harkonens. Despite getting more screen time than in the previous movie but still feel flat and are not fleshed out. Skarsgard is still doing his impression of Brando from \"Apocalypse Now\" and completely lacks energy, charisma and determination that you'd expect a planet leader like him to have. Butler overacts way too much for me to take him seriously while Batista... Well, he is just Batista.The title of worst offender, however, goes to Christopher Walken who brings nothing interesting to the role of emperor. He just looks old, tired, confused and like that he doesn't want to be there, which is shocking knowing that Walken is a type who usually gives 110% in all of his roles.Another problem is pacing and story. While the first half is excellent, second half feels rushed. There's suddenly so many things happening at the same time and there's not nearly enough time to flesh any of that out. We also get some pointless storylines that just choke the movie and go nowhere, such as Chani acting like a contrarian for no reason whatsoever and completely pointless side plot in which Feyd impregnates Farring (who, by the way, is male in the book).Finally, there are changes from the book that damage the movie. I already mentioned changes in Chani's character and pointless gender swapping, but key characters such as Alia, Thufir Hawat and navigators are completely absent. OK, not completely, as Alia spends whole movie in her mother's womb, but she should have been there whole time and properly fleshed out, which is something they definitely had time for. The combination of all these factors contribute to a very anticlimactic climax in the end.And also - what's up with all those close-ups?That all said, this is still a movie worth watching. Most of the takes in this review are purely subjective so take them with grain of salt. I fully encourage everyone to go see this movie and make their own opinion. If nothing else, the visual and audial experience makes it worth watching.8/10.",

That was Pole, indeed: with all his kindness, fate and transformations.Florence Pugh. Wow! I hated Irulan from the book. But here: I saw an intelligent, interesting lady.(Here I should say: guilty, I notice these 2 all the time, so in love with \"Little women\")\nRebecca Ferguson finally nailed it. There is no even a sign of this soft and scared Jessica. Jessica from Dune 2 kept me nervous all the time.Chani? Nah. Something is wrong here. Zendaya like came for one more photo shoot.Script. Script! It is strong. Finally, we watch a fantastic movie and every character is well written. Everything has logic (except for Jessica looking extremely happy that the war is approaching).That's not an apple to apple Dune like we've all read. It's better to say: \"based on Dune\". They took the idea and were careful with it. \"Plans in plans\" is not something you can adapt, but I feel that that the writers did their best: I knew what would happen and when, but they managed to get me.Visual part. These epic scenes! \"Arrakis is so beautiful when the sun is low\".To conclude: I want more! I want this film to become part of my collection! I want to see Anya Taylor-Joy and Jason Momoa too (while I doubt that these 2 will have chemistry, but still).Definitely recommend. That's the fantastic movie we've all been waiting for.",

    "Review Content": "Dune 2\" is a cinematic masterpiece that captivates audiences with its stunning visuals, compelling storytelling, and immersive world-building. Directed by visionary filmmaker Denis Villeneuve, this sequel to the acclaimed \"Dune\" delivers an epic sci-fi experience that surpasses expectations.The film picks up where its predecessor left off, diving deeper into the intricate political machinations and rich mythology of Frank Herbert's iconic universe. Villeneuve's meticulous attention to detail ensures that every frame is meticulously crafted, from the sweeping desert landscapes of Arrakis to the intricately designed costumes and technology of its inhabitants.The cast delivers standout performances, with Timothée Chalamet reprising his role as the conflicted hero Paul Atreides, and Zendaya shining as the enigmatic Fremen warrior Chani. Oscar Isaac, Rebecca Ferguson, and Javier Bardem also deliver memorable performances, bringing depth and complexity to their characters.What truly sets \"Dune 2\" apart is its thematic depth and emotional resonance. Beneath the grand spectacle lies a poignant exploration of power, destiny, and the consequences of one's choices. As Paul grapples with his newfound role as a leader and the burden of his prophesied destiny, the film raises thought-provoking questions about identity, sacrifice, and the nature of humanity.Visually stunning, intellectually stimulating, and emotionally resonant, \"Dune 2\" is a triumph of modern cinema that will leave audiences eagerly anticipating the next installment. Denis Villeneuve has once again proven himself as a master storyteller, and \"Dune 2\" stands as a testament to his unparalleled talent and vision.",

The sound design is magnificent. Every time you hear the beat of the music, your chest will shake.-Story-\nThe storytelling in each act always makes me curious and interested to see the continuation in the next acts. The character development of Paul \"Muad'Dib\" Atreides and his mother is very good. From being a nobody, the community is even skeptical, to being trusted and revered.-Interpretation-\nFor those of you who study eschatology, understanding this movie will not be difficult. Especially if you learn from several religions. The concepts of messiah, al-mahdi, anti-christ, and prophethood are all here. For myself, I ended up wondering again. About the eschatological concept that I currently believe in. Maybe the promised al-masih & al-mahdi, the concept can match what Frank Herbert wrote (maybe). After all, Frank must also have been inspired by the eschatological concepts of existing religions.",

As i mentioned before it felt a bit rushed sometimes but that is to be expected when you make a movie adaptation of a book so that did not bother me that much. I do however believe that this film needs to be rated R in order for it to reach its fullest potential. Showing a bit more realism in the battles etc would have made this a 10/10 for me.

    "Review Title": "The most overrated movie in a decade",
    "Review Date": "2024-02-29",
    "Review Content": "How many times haven't we seen movies that people try to build up like masterpieces even before they get released, that is also the case with Dune Part Two who already was expected to be the next Lord Of The Rings franchise or something like that. If they managed to actually deliver on that it would be no problem, but this movie is actually even worse than the first one and dragged in a lot of moments.I would really say it is heavily overrated because when you create a movie that lasts almost 3 hours you need to create more quality, Denis Villeneuve the director here recently talked about that people want longer movies, but then he needs to create more quality in the process.It especially feels dragged after Atredes drinks that water of life to see visions even stronger, and it becomes once again all about building up an even greater war you of course remember in the first movie that you tried to build up this great war, but now you build up an even greater war which will happen in 3'rd movie but in that process it becomes a dragged affair. You have some fight scenes some talk about alliances but things are done very messy here and it includes the fight scenes, which only show about one good fight. The one between Atredes and. Feyd Rautha where you manage to create intensity. The rest are pretty weak and there's a general feeling that you are supposed to feel the tense dramatic mood with the music rather than you should see the movie deliver intensity and dramatic moments in the scenes.Another problem is the general forced creation of comic moments in the movie. That is especially seen in the Stilgar character that goes on a forced rampage trying to make everybody laugh when in reality it is just a forced attempt to create jokes, which are not really funny but of course everybody in the cinema laughs at them.. because they feel forced too or are so spellbound by the Dune movie. That's why also the movie at times actually can feel childish. That's not to say that you can't have comic moments, but they do not need to be so forced.Another issue I will discuss are the too many characters which I feel we see in a lot of movies these days, with the character gallery here it is hard to create a good movie. In addition the evil guys like Rabban, The emperor played by Christopher Walken and Feyd Rautha are hardly in this movie when they actually are very much interesting character but really aren't allowed to shine that much. Because the story has a heavy buildup where Atredes needs to be the master of the desert and gain the confidence from The Fermen to be their leader and those moments are the most important in this one, the creation of a legend of his own that almost could have been the first movie and the second could have been the prequel.That's another problem I think that this movie although it builds on the first movie, but it really feels like a part of a double buildup. Which then again throws me away from calling it a masterpiece, of course I am not saying we need war all the time but the focus is so much on the desert people and less on the evil side trying to take down Atredes and we don't see tense fights, so that's why for me I am dissapointed and I can't stretch my rating to more than a 5/10.",

Denis Villeneuve takes bizarre and unnecessary liberties with the plot of the book, which leaves his narrative weak in places where author Frank Herbert's is strong. In addition, there are critical characters and concepts missing in the film, and while Herbert's book takes place over several years, Villeneuve's adaptation occurs over the course of a few months, which is simply not feasible given the actual events unfolding in it. Overall, it's a bad film with good actors and a big budget. If you want an epic popcorn movie experience and care nothing about the book, you might enjoy it.

Others were obviously there for the paycheck.I hope others enjoy it and maybe someone can sit with me and explain the appeal because I fear that I'm the one telling \"the emperor that he's not wearing any clothes\".Dune 1 & 2.

K so it's very fresh in my mind, i went with my Mrs who's not a great fan of these movies and actually found part one boring. But she was won over by the completion of the first book here in Frank Herberts masterpiece of novels. She actually came out the cinema and said suppose there will be a part three? And I think there was a gleam in her eye of anticipation. Unfortunately she hasn't read Dune messiah. She also looked at me and said the film trailers were kind of rubbish, and you may think this has nothing to do with my review of Dune part 2 but it has everything to do with it. When the rest of Hollywood biggest films this year in the trailers for the next few months are another Ghostbusters another Godzilla Vs Kong another Deadpool another mad max film and weird looking over the top borderlands movie.I haven't seen a single one of those movies yet but I can guarantee not a single one of those films mentioned will have better visuals, better sound, better script, better acting, better cast, better score and a perfect runtime than what I witnessed last night watching Dune part 2. This is a spoiler free review like all my reviews. And if you liked part one well part 2 just ups everything on screen.Being a huge fan of the novels and a movie lover I understand there needed to be characters cut dialogue cut, events altered and changed but as a film adaptation it's a solid adaptation. If you want the full unabridged version read the book if you want both versions like I do read the book and watch the film. I've rated this film a 10 but no film is perfect I think it's sits around 9.5 just because I've read the books and was expecting some important things in the novel to be that weren't.I must give an honourable mention to three stand out performances. Rebecca Ferguson played with awesome mannipletive intense intent her portrayal here is the unlitmate weaver of plans within plans.Austin Butler, wow I could of watched a full movie on his demonic villanery easily as memorable as the first time Darth maul turned on his double sided light saber when he's finally introduced. Javier Bardem excellent comic timing and a true believer in the cause. My final word is well people if you want more films like this support this in the cinema or you will end up with more films I mentioned in the trailers.",

I am so glad to see it in a movie theater compared to waiting to watch it at home, you definitely want the whole sound/visual experience of a good theater.

But while watching part two I realized it's not just about the main plot. It's the music, it's the visuals, the sounds, the acting, the rawness.I think everything in this movie is perfect, when you see it from a visual and sound perspective.While I think the story is wonderful, I feel it was almost too fast phased. I discussed with friends who has not read the book about the story. Which they did not really understand at all times. Because of the movies fast phase in the second half of the movie.I won't discuss these specific storywise stuff. But when you see the movie from a book-perspective. The story is exceptional and rich.While I know you can't really copy-paste the book to the movie. It still contains the main plot points and does so with excellence. But I can't deny that I wanted to see some more things that was included in the book but not in the movie.Certain characters, cough cough.. Seemed to be forgotten from the first part.But overall I totally loved the movie. And I also like that it takes it's own little road to make it a \"better\" cinematic experience. But I know that some will whine about the difference between book and movie. I think it's great that they make the movie in a way that still cherish the source material but does some changes probably are necessary for production and overall experience.If you'll whine about the movie not being exactly like the book you should just go read the book. I really hope an extended cut will be released for us all to enjoy this movie in 4h instead of 3.I would perhaps put this movie in the 8.5+ area. But since this is imdb it deserves a 10. Thanks.",

The superb star-cast deliver the goods. Special mention to Zendaya for her steely performance. Austin Butler was aptly menacing. Stellan was stellar.This is one of the greatest sequels of all time.

The movie was dull and I was glancing at the time about an hour into it. Zendaya's character motivation changed at least twice in the movie and I couldn't understand why all of a sudden she wasn't keen on Timothee Chalamat's character wanting to embrace his destiny. There were aspects that were simply unexplained in the story. All of a sudden Paul Atriedes sees the past/present/future because he tells the audience he can due to the Water of Life. The enemies from the first film are simply reduced and the heroes in the movie actually turn into the villains. Visually the movie is stunning but the plot and characters are flimsy. Dune Part One did a better job because the movie went out of its way to explain things better through either visuals or spoken words and the characters made sense.Honestly, if you're going to watch a film from this director, check out Incendies.",

It is a huge disappointment that he has literally \"deleted\" the Guild Navigators. We see nothing between Gurney and Jessica, important dialogues are missing, some scenes are literally invented, Alia is not born before the victory, in fact she is not born at all. Paul's children also do not appear, and not only that, but it is clear from the film that Chani and Paul seem to have no connection and she is against every decision he makes.The whole plot is a mess, no matter how original the director's idea was to change and transform the plot. This is still a novel and some basic timelines, events and characters need to be respected, which are completely missing here. Although David Lynch's version is old and outdated, the director managed to fit almost all the important moments and events into three times less film time, while this one wastes time on Taliban chants, frog-like sound passwords, and meaningless lines between the \"Fremen\". By the way, where are the secret Atreides sound modules?This is my opinion.",

    "Review Content": "Being nothing short of spectacular in terms of production design, acting, score and cinematography, Dune Part II surpasses the triumph of its predecessor Dune and creates a new level of memorable, breathtaking scenes. Paul Atreides riding a Sandworm for the first timing or uniting the Fremen behind him are good examples. Timothee Chalamet fulfills the task of portraying an initially humble Messiah yearning to be equal to Fremen rather than to control them who turns into a self-righteous, self-proclaimed leader with excellence. Nevertheless, Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen is the star of the movie for me personally with his unforgettable performance. He evokes feelings of repulsion and horror with ease and fully melts with the role such that I forgot that it is Austin Butler playing him. However, turning to my main issue with this movie, which cost it one Star, is the story as it has not fulfilled its potential. Focusing on the evolution of Paul Autreides in depth and showing life of the Fremen as well of the Harkonnen, the Bene Gisserit are left in the dark. Also, the purpose of having a sister remains unclear. This makes Dune: Messiah a necessity to give fans a fulminant wrap up of the fate of the planet Dune.",

The world-building and the world itself, along with our characters, makes you wanna snort a pile full of spice straight from the sand dunes of Arrakis and fight alongside Paul Atreides the entire time. That's how immersive the story, visuals, and music are. It is UNMATCHED.A generation-defining film indeed, and when we discuss sequels, this could very well stand in contrast with 'The Empire Strikes Back,' 'The Dark Knight,' and 'The Two Towers'-or even surpass them in some cases. We owe Denis a great debt for this masterpiece. You can keep your expectations as high as the sky, but Denis will blow your mind either way and show you that even the sky isn't the limit.

I love the work of Denis Villeneuve, particularly in relationship to Dune he did Blade Runner 2049 which is one of my favorites and Arrival which I greatly enjoyed.You can tell this joint is visually stunning, despite it just being desert scenes. I did spend a little more cheddar to see it on the best screen which I do not regret.The movie does expect you to know something about what came before it but obviously I can't blame them. I saw the first Dune which is the only reason why the first hour makes sense. Then we get into the second hour, and I have to say this movie is not filled with much conflict. I felt nothing for Paul Atriedes played by Timothee Chalamet, I ponder why Chani, played by Zendaeya was even there and I'm not sure who the bad guy was as Dave Bauista's, Glossu was a winning baby Stellan Skargard seems senseless and I was more bedazzled with Christopher Walken because it felt like forever sense, I see him in something. These are the main character in a huge assemble cast and I could not have care less.Who did do something for me is Javier Bardem as Stiligar whose Morpheus from the Matrix-like belief in Paul was entertaining, Rebecca Ferguson as Paul's mom who I felt gave the best subtle but sinister performance of all the subtle but sinister performances in the movie and Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha who stole the scene whenever he was on it.The third hour of the movie was where the story picked up how I wanted to but by then I was tired and wanted it to be over. I was not bored out of my mind with part two but is seems like Villeneuve ability to make a complex Sci-fi film that is masterfully quiet with the story but loud with the Visual and Sound effects worked for me better with his sequel to Blade Runner.",

The movie plots from 10,000 years in the future which accommodates different entities with different powers no one has thought of. The Kingdom (House Harkonnen) who wants to collect spice (one of the dominant thing) by which they can raise non-identical powers to rule the world and the Arrakis are the ones who protects it. You will experience ways of wars from old to new techniques all at once. Also some discrete strategies of war not ever seen. Occasionally, it might get boring and mostly it will bombshell your thoughts. Each cast in the movie has acted deeply which delves you in it. The screening of the movie connects you with all the emotions intensely. Confusing if you are not in your state of mind. One of the masterpiece and can't wait for the next part.

(Although almost all interpretations do, maybe it's just the psychological effect of a desert.)So, where they really depart from previous versions is main characters have serious doubt about what they are doing. While this is hinted at in the book, it is much more overt here. (It isn't until the second Book that Paul really starts to realize what a mess he's made of things.)The Character of Chani is a departure. While she is totally devoted to Paul in the book, here she's the one screaming that this is wrong (even though they are aiming for the same goal.)The character of Feyd Ruatha was really good as a villian, for anyone still traumatized by the image of Sting in metal speedos in the 84 version, this is so much better. He's a psychopath and it's obvious.The battle scene at the end is quite impressive, but utlimately forgettable. But this is the curse of modern movies, I guess.Worth a watch?

I enjoyed my time watching Dune 2, but i believe Diune 1 being just superior.I found it tiresome when almost whole movie was filmed with dunes in background. I know it's silly \"issue\" that plenty of you will scoff at, but the movie lacks the variety of environments/scenes Dune 1 provided. I will, however, nod at the gladiator arena. It was great. Maybe if we had some more \"okay lets take out eyes away from sands for a moment\" scenes, things would have been better.Another minor issue of mine is music. There's 1 theme going whenever something important happens and it fits great, but, due to repetition of it, at some point you begin to just phase it out. Diune 1 - remember the scene of Atreides being attacked by Harkonnen and Sardaukars? That scene, that music. It burned into my memory. There's no such thing in Dune 2, unfortunately. There are great scenes in dune 2 for sure, but they lack the 'oompf' feel that music provides.Plot. There won't be any spoilers. I'd say i am quite focused watcher, but there were few parts i didn't understand. It feels like some scenes were cut, or altered and movie had those few small and jarring stumbles. Flow was disrupted.Characters. I enjoyed Stilgars performance alot. Lady Jessicas character was uhh, she plays much bigger role here and i was slightly tired of her at some point. I really did not enjoy how they portrayed The Emperor. They couldn't make him more weak willed and no-presence even if they tried.I'm using kind of simple, yet pretty solid way of scoring a movie. I ask myself few questions: Was I fully entertained? Did i felt the lenght of the movie? And finally: would i watch it again? Entertained I was, i did feel the time of the movie... And i wouldn't watch it again. There's simply nothing for me to return to. Nothing to \"re-live\" again. What about Dune 1? Oh heck i will watch again!Either way for me it was a 7/10 which means: Good. Neither great, nor average.",

The combination of the two was such a wonderful idea that Dune novelist Frank Herbert had and I am thankful that he created this world for us to enjoy. Timothy does a great job as Paul and Zendaya as Chani. Austin Butler though, I was super pleased to hear him not sound like Elvis. He really played this character brutally and it was so necessary. Stellan Skarsgaard is incredible as you would expect and I could also picture Gary Oldman in the role as the baron as well (Just a side note).

I felt like it was done more for the visual \"spectacle\" of having hand to hand fighting but it didn't make sense in universe.2. The Fremen seemingly have to trek great distances to get to these attack sites, there was a scene near the end where their army all.aprar St the top of the sand dune by the depot and would be absolutely knackered by the time they traversed the miles of sand between them and the enemy3. This brings me on to my point about them \"riding\" the worms as they seemingly have little control apart from nominal left and right movement. You never see them stopping the worms and dismounting. The worms never seem to stop so you would likely have to leap off, almost certainly to your death.Linked into this there were scenes where there was a whole caravan of people including Lady Jessica in a Fremen style Sedan chair, how the hell did they all safely mount the worm and remain tethered and again how did they all dismount?Lastly there was the horrible dirge of Hans Zimmer's \"score\". I know this is just personal taste, but I prefer music with a theme and melody rather than just atonal blats from a foghorn.I'm sure Dune fans will absolutely love this and I'm pleased they've got a faithful adaptation. I also recognise the efforts of the cast and crew I just found it to be overly long and a bit dull.This was a watch once and don't need to see it again film for me.I won't be watching the next one.So caught up in it's own mythology that it fails to give any interesting characters that you can root for.It inspires no emotional engagement when the characters are all dull.Visually bland.",

    "Review Content": "Having enjoyed the sheer scale and artistic vision of the first episode of Dune, I couldn't not see this in the cinema. All those elements return, along with a host of perfect faces in the cast, standout performers clearly being Rebecca Ferguson and Javier Bardem. There were just 3 problems I had which knocked a star off my rating each.The beginning was overlong and dull. I grew sick of Chalamets face and all the reverence by his people (perhaps that was the point). All this buildup for a Messiah character, ok we get it, it's quite boring to see the prophecy coming true too.Plot advancement seemed to jump forward extremely quickly between scenes, one instance being when he's sent out into the desert on a survival trial, but the next minute he's back with the crew attacking the bad guys. Talking of the bad guys, the viewing experience was far more enjoyable to me whenever they had screen time, welcome relief from 'Mary Sue' Paul. The Harkonnens are a disgustingly evil bunch of folks and deserved more backstory.Then the anticipated epic final battle, what a dud. It's over in the blink of an eye and wraps up the film awkwardly. I was expecting the film to end just before this part, setting up a mouthwatering finale in part 3, so I wonder if there really is going to be one due to this ending.Overall a must watch if you've seen the first. +Strong cinematics, -weak storytelling.",

The last 2 movies had been building to this huge battle and show down to only see like 2 minutes of the huge battle was so upsetting. Was looking for a battle of Minas Tirith level. This was the focal point of the last 2 movies coming to a head. The Sardaukar were laughable, what should of been an epic show down with the Fremen was transformed into them being nothing more than an over hyped force being slaughtered with no effort. Overall still really enjoyed the movie, and is definitely something that Hollywood needed and needs to take note of on how to make blockbuster sci fi movies again but just had the action.",

It altered the events, the motivations, and the outcomes of the story. It ignored the subtlety and the symbolism of the book.

    "Review Date": "2024-03-05",
    "Review Content": "My perspective so you understand my review better:I'm American, from New York originally. Too poor right now or ever to leave the country! I haven't watched the other Dune movies. And haven't read the Dune books. I'm also shallow. I don't watch horror because the monsters are ugly and I don't want to look at it. But, I can read horror books. No visuals. If I were to write a horror screenplay. I'd write a beautiful monster.Okay my review:I watched a Brazilian soap opera called O Clone. Many of the main characters in that soap were Muslim. They were beautiful. Especially when not in public, because, hello modesty! So, I can understand Muslims and different ethnicities such as the Arabs, Persians, Urdu, Igbo, etc can be beautiful people with beautiful costumes and customs and buildings. At least in a Brazilian soap opera!!Why do I bring this up?Well, I'm glad you asked!This Dune movie seems to be a Muslim knock off.I may be an American bumkin who hasn't left the country but, I have heard Arabic, I have heard of the words Makdi and Jin and know what they mean. I know how religious people dress.This movie copied it all!! Along with other Muslim references.And I'm sorry to be so simple and shallow. But this movie has ugly protagonists people in sad, ugly outfits. They have ugly villain people in sad, ugly outfits.They have ugly buildings. They have ugly sand dunes. An ugly dessert.Even annoying background classical music the whole time. I'm not sure what kind of classical music that is. Too dramatic what ever it is.I mean the cinematography is impressive and I get how someone can think it's classy looking for that reason.I mean the movie is too much of a Muslim copying knock off and so it's hard for me to get over that. It just makes it too uncreative. And, I don't know if I'd be offended if I were Muslim or not. But, in my Brazilian Soap Opera there was more respect for them and humanity in them. A picture of a people with a life and a soul and a rich culture was shown.Visually, and culturally it's offensive. But, not only that, the copying of the plot religious wise is offensive too!! I mean the plot makes too many references to religious prophecies and predictions and it's offensive because it's just not right to exploit something holy like that. Not just prophecies but even prayer customs.And these fake Muslims are at war with another people. And their holy war and struggles in this movie seems really offensive to me too. I mean, they are making cinema and entertainment of the struggles of middle easterners and Africans? I don't know how to think of this.This movie tries to act emotional and show their struggles but it seems to make everyone a caricature rather than a real people with a soul and life.The movie is really a one note plot too. It's like overly milking the lead up to war and figuring out all that.I don't understand why they have so many sword fights in advanced technology societies.They show sand. And underground tunnels or rooms? I'm not even sure. I need a map. I wish the movie showed architecture or cities or something. I just saw and scenes with a lot of people. Not able to gain a sense of what this world is.Well anyway, dramatic music, cinematography and serious war conversations aside, it's hard for me to take this movie seriously because of everything that I mentioned.This movie has high reviews because it seems people are simps for high, intense, over drama cinamentography and over the top emotional war drama it seems.And it's forever long. And drags on that one note forever!",

    "Review Title": "Under the sands was buried an addition to the sci-fi genre that carries some spice: A Review of Dune 2",
    "Review Date": "2024-03-01",
    "Review Content": "Denis Villeneuve's Dune 2 has personally done for me what Revenge of the Sith done for many parents watching it when it first released. The development of the story of Paul Atreides is shaping itself to be a tragic one, reflective of the story in the book. Paul Muad'dib is sadly taking his own Anakin-like route down this fictional universe.What Dune established is further cemented and cemented very well by Dune 2, Denis Villeneuve has delivered a groundbreaking addition into the Science-fiction genre and it is one that in comparison to its sluggish predecessor, is one to remember. There are emotions here and such a connection to this universe that is crafted that cannot be said to not be genuinely making you want to see more.As we follow the story of the Fremen and Paul Atreides' (Timothee Chalamet) fulfilment of his true legacy, we start to wrestle with the dangerous idea of faith and despair - for the struggles of the Fremen can only be ended by the arrival of the Lisan Al Gaib - this being a sacrificial path to take. The world building Denis Villeneuve puts into play is to me\nlike none other that we've seen for a long time, of course Dune 1 is equally as amazing yet what Dune 2 manages to add on is just unbelievable.Regarding the casting, there are some soon-to-come Oscar's whose rightful owners should belong to the cast of Dune 2. Timothee Chalamet for one has undoubtedly proven himself in recent years as one of this generations acting powerhouse - from his flamboyant portrayal of Willy Wonka to his role as the deeply confused teenager Elio in Call Me By Your Name. His portrayal of Paul Atreides in this installment of the Dune universe is gripping and impactful, we are seeing a \"troubled villain\" in the making and his portrayal of the religiously haunted saint of the Fremen is incredible, as he balances saving those he cares about with discovering who he truly is. As for Chani (played by the talented Zendaya) there is not much to say due to sheer awe. Zendaya is an emotional lead and a powerhouse at the front of the Fremen, she embodies the struggles of the people of the dunes battling the corruption of religious fanaticism. I was also very charmed and taken off guard by the sheer excellence of Austin Butler's Feyd-Rautha, the new governor of Arrakis. To say he may be the best villain since Heath Ledger's much respected Joker would not be undeserving praise. However, Feyd-Rautha sadly suffers from the issue that comes with killing a villain off too quickly, being that his true potential is not fully witnessed. It was also very nice to see the lovely Javier Bardem play both a religiously devoted fanatic and Timothee Chalamet's biggest hypeman, though I do wish Dennis Villeneuve had explored more the gripping conflict plaguing his mind - due to Stilgar being a plagued man in the books, struggling with his devotion to this prophecy. As for the rest of the supporting cast - whose roles though at times did not take the spotlight as much - don't leave much to be said except for sheer appreciation for such a passionate portrayal. Rebecca Ferguson stepping into the reverend mother identity of Lady Jessica and giving up a lot of the things she cared for is such a sad portrayal of a mothers sometimes sacrificial role. Equally, Josh Brolin (Avengers Endgame, No Country For Old Men) and his portrayal of Gurney is better than ever with his character truly being such a good shoulder to lean on for our young Atreides. The whole cast is deserving of so many applauds for their chemistry and ability to connect to bring this universe alive, never felt more connected to a cast and their characters who I have now\ncome to love.The world of Arrakis and its other less explored planets also never feels more alive and that's not because they are genuine real\nplaces but rather because Greig Fraser's cinematography has managed to make the dunes of Arrakis as real as possible. The visuals - to say they are captivating - is an understatement, this is a world that feels alive filled with grief and hopelessness in the very sands and through its very people, the Fremen. Greig Fraser builds such a beautiful Arrakis - utilising the Panavision H-Series lenses and the re-housed Soviet Helios 40-2 Lens from The Batman - that it is simply\nmesmerising. Also absolutely loved the experimentation with Feyd-Rautha's black and white intro scene, I always love when black and white is incorporated into modern cinema, it gives films such a charm.As for the soundtrack that is largely on repeat as this is being written, from 'Cornfield Chase' to 'A Time of Quiet Between the Worms', Hans Zimmer once again develops his case for this generations and the past's greatest composer. The World of Arrakis, the emergence of the Shai-Hulud and the evil of the Harkonnens's cannot be bought to life without this soundtrack. 'A Time of Quiet Between the Worms' and its explosive counterpart, 'Beginnings Are Such Delicate Times' are genuinely two soundtracks that have made me so reminiscent of Gladiator's 'Now We Are Free', another genius score from Hans Zimmer.Denis Villeneuve's Dune 2 is deserving of a cinematic legacy, to be remembered as one of those greats and equally to be loved, for a film such as this comes once every 20 years. No\nmovie in recent years has quite made me feel\nquite like a kid and taken me, for 3 hours, to a completely different world. People should genuinely give Dune 2 the chance it rightfully deserves and cherish this cinematic experience for it does not happen as often as we wish it would. Thank you Denis for making this possible.",

    "Review Date": "2024-03-02",
    "Review Content": "These will be general impressions of this film, whereas my review of the first film was more detailed as far as characters and plot goes. In its initial release, many cinemas have been screening Dune and Dune: Part Two back-to-back, which I would recommend if you haven't seen the first film yet. The story is dense and you would be completely lost if you start watching this series with the sequel. That being said, there is handy plot exposition in the dialogue at the start to refresh your memory of what happened in the first film (I saw the first film in the cinema in early December, 2021 and didn't rewatch it prior to seeing Dune: Part Two today, although I have read my Dune review a few times since then, so that was also a refresher, of sorts).Not being fanatical about this story as far as reading the source material or watching the first Dune more than once, I have to say that I don't think that I grasped everything that happens in the sequel. I was vague on details about who people were or the origins of peoples. E.g. At the start of the film, I was thinking that a young woman was our hero's (Paul Atreides, played by Timothée Chalamet) sister but it turns out that she was his mother. My review of Dune doesn't mention that she looked too young to play his mother but she does. That Paul says \"sister\" around her sometimes didn't help me. Later on I saw an older man in a scene and I thought he might have been one of the good guys from the first film but since he was in a spice harvester now, I was confused. Why was he in that? I'm not sure that that is explained satisfactorily but that does raise one issue that I had with this film: being able to clearly understand the dialogue being spoken. Sometimes it was unclear due to characters' accents, other times due to ambient noise and other other times due to stylistic effects being utilised. It would have been good if I could have heard the last thing that Paul says to Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (played by Stellan Skarsgård). It's at times like these that being able to rewind the film or turn on closed captions would have been appreciated.Not being able to recall how romantically involved Paul was with Chani (Zendaya) in the first film, it did seem that in the sequel their romance blossomed at a very fast rate. Perhaps more time had elapsed that I realised within the sequel itself, as far as that went. Sometimes the transitions from one scene to a different one was unclear. For instance, there's one scene where Paul is meant to be having a trial in the desert by himself and in the next scene it wasn't clear to me that the man in a military ambush was him but in my defence, he did have his face covered in the latter scene. So, maybe these switches were handled too abruptly or maybe I just lost concentration during the transition.There are many times in Dune: Part Two where some of the 'natives' on the planet Arrakis comment that their religion is just a means for others to manipulate them for the other's political ends. Similarly, the same sentiment is expressed by some of the colonisers too. At the risk of sounding like comedian Kenny Everett's character Quentin Pose: \"religion is the opiate of the masses and yet...\". And yet, on the other hand, the all-female religious order does have what seems like supernatural abilities. In other words, it's hard to be definitive about what is happening with the hero's journey here.Another time I felt more detached watching this film was just finding silly how Paul exceeded the prophecies concerning 'the chosen one'. The signs or proof of Paul's prophetic status are magnified and overblown. Then there's the issue of him being white and being worshipped by the non-white 'natives'. No doubt there is a post-colonial critique to be made here. Just a question for myself: are the 'natives' of a Arrakis genuinely of this planet or were they just the first colonists there? Did the first film explain that? Did the book explain that? My last word on finding the film silly at times would be those scenes where characters worm-ski. Really? It's probably fortunate that no attempt is made in the film to try and rationalise that, because I doubt that I could suspend my disbelief.Towards the end of the film there was a point where I thought that that conclusion would serve as the end point of the series, perhaps. However, the story continued and made it obvious that that wouldn't be the case. Since I haven't read the book on which the films are based, if I was to hazard a guess, I would say that this Dune story would be a trilogy but I wouldn't rule out a 4th film in this arc. In other words, this would be a 3 or 4 film adaptation of the original Dune book by Frank Herbert (I imagine part 4 as being some sort of 3 hour epilogue). I'm still interested and invested in this story. I want to see how the relationship between Paul and Chani evolves. With this sequel, the worlds depicted did seem quite alien but the thought occurred to me that it would be familiar to people who lived in earlier times, for instance, those attending the Nuremberg rallies or the Colosseum 'back in the day'.Note: I didn't see a listing for a 3D screening for this film in cinemas here but the closing credits makes it clear that such a version exists. I can't vouch in that case as to how worthwhile it would be to view that version. When I saw one of the Disney Star Wars films in 3D it was laughably woeful on that front. The first Avatar film is the benchmark on that front.Random notes:* I toyed with scoring this film 70%, then 75% seemed most likely but I decided to add a \"+\" sign to that, which is my tipping point for adding a star to my rating, as IMDB does not do half stars.* I laughed out loud when one character said words to the effect that Paul's denial of being the messiah was proof Paul was the messiah!* Christopher Walken is such a distinctive looking individual that he stands out like a dog's bollocks, visually. The rest of the cast didn't have that 'baggage' with me, even though I've seen some of them in unrelated films. In other words, I thought \"that's Christopher Walken\" when I saw him. Perhaps you could say that his presence affected my 'immersion' in this world.* Nice misdirection in the final fight scene.* American pronunciation of \"Dune\" by Paul, as in \"doon\".* As per my review of the first Dune film, I've collected another IMDB \"Iron bladder\" trophy.",

    "Review Date": "2024-03-01",
    "Review Content": "In the landscape of contemporary cinema, where the regurgitation of narratives often leaves the palate desiring more, \"Dune: Part Two\" emerges not merely as a film but as a transcendent experience. Denis Villeneuve, already a maestro of visual storytelling, elevates his craft to an echelon that few contemporaries dare to aspire towards. This sequel not only surpasses its predecessor but redefines the parameters of what science fiction can achieve.The narrative architecture of \"Dune: Part Two\" is both intricate and exquisite, weaving together the grand tapestry of Frank Herbert's universe with a meticulousness that is nothing short of breathtaking. Villeneuve's adaptation is not merely content with visual spectacle (though the film is replete with such moments); it is the emotional resonance, the palpable tension of the Atreides' saga that anchors the film. The director's ability to balance the macrocosm of interstellar politics with the microcosm of personal vendettas and alliances is a feat of narrative dexterity.The cinematography, courtesy of Greig Fraser, is a masterclass in visual poetry. Each frame is meticulously crafted, with the use of light and shadow not merely serving the aesthetic but deepening the thematic layers of the story. The landscapes of Arrakis are rendered with a stark beauty that is both alien and intimately familiar, a testament to the cinematographer's vision and skill.Hans Zimmer's score is, to put it simply, a revelation. The auditory landscape he constructs is as vast and complex as the visual one, with motifs and themes that echo the narrative's emotional beats. Zimmer's music does not just accompany the film; it elevates it, transforming scenes into symphonies of sight and sound.Performances across the board are stellar, with Timothée Chalamet's portrayal of Paul Atreides showing a maturity and depth that surpasses his earlier work. The supporting cast, including Zendaya, Javier Bardem, and Austin Butler, among others, bring gravitas and nuance to their roles, making the world of \"Dune\" feel lived-in and real.In conclusion, \"Dune: Part Two\" is not just a film; it is a monumental achievement in storytelling, visual art, and cinema. It challenges the viewer, not just to watch, but to immerse themselves in the rich tapestry of its universe. Villeneuve has not only created a sequel worthy of Herbert's legacy; he has crafted a masterpiece that stands as a beacon of what the future of filmmaking can aspire to be. A resounding 10/10, \"Dune: Part Two\" is a cinematic odyssey that reimagines the potential of its genre.",

Frank Herbert's Dune is my favorite book of all time, and I was more than pleased with the translation to the screen that Denis Villeneuve masterfully put together. The scenery, world-building, character development, music, sound effects, pacing, and overall feeling, in my opinion, perfect for this story. There were a few changes from the book that made the story easier to digest on screen, which I felt was appropriate and made the movie better than it would have been had it directly adapted every detail of the book.I especially loved this movie's depiction of Paul's internal struggle with a desire for revenge while at the same time growing love for Chani and the Fremen people. He is clearly stuck in the middle of expectations, controlled prophecies, love, loss, and fear of greater loss and suffering. All of this internal turmoil is heard in Paul's words, tone, and seen on his face. Lady Jessica's portrayal is terrifying and unsettling. Chani is the heartbeat of the story and allows the audience a figure to connect with and respond to the events of the film with. Stilgar is devout and unironically hilarious at times.Every shot of the movie is a work of art. I plan to go back for a 2nd viewing.",

    "Review Date": "2024-02-29",
    "Review Content": "Dune: Part Two is a modern epic and will be watched, studied, praised and remembered for decades to come! This is the Lawrence of Arabia, Ben-Hur, Ten Commandments, Lord of the Rings & Empire Strikes Back of this generation. YES, it's that damn amazing. If it wasn't already clear with Part One, it is safe to say that Denis Villeneuve has ushered in a new era of mega sci-fi blockbuster filmmaking, that leaves little room to be matched, if only by its inevitable sequel and conclusion to this trilogy, Dune: Messiah.If Dune: Part One was the appetizer, then Dune: Part Two is what can only be described as the main course, as Villeneuve himself has put it. The action is on another level with superbly choreographed fight scenes that is worthy of being at the top of the sci-fi genre. The lore and mythology is expanded upon greatly and what Denis has brought to the screen is truly a cinematic achievement. Following Part One's Best Picture nomination and 6 Academy Award wins, this may very well be a huge contender next year.Timothée Chalamet COMMANDS his presence on screen in an unbelievably powerful performance that leaves you both in awe and unease. His evolution into the Muad'Dib, the \"Messiah\", is a journey of discovery and Timothée portrays the complex nature of it to perfection. The level of intensity and depth is prevalent throughout the film and the journey of him being just a boy next in line for the throne, to the leader of the Fremen is remarkable. This entire cast is an A-list cast, with fantastic after fantastic actors appearing and bringing more dimensions to their character from Part One, along with the new ones played by Austin Butler as the psychotic Feyd-Rautha, Florence Pugh as Princess Irulan, Léa Seydoux as Lady Margot Fenring and Christopher Walken as The Emperor. All of them shine through and become apart of this franchise effortlessly. The highlight is Butler, as he transformers into a complete monster with a taste for blood and death. He instantly becomes a character that will be remembered as one of the toughest & fearsome villains in sci-fi history.Hans Zimmer's absolutely INCREDIBLE score soars through the auditorium in a euphoric way and completely mesmerizes you upon what you are witnessing on screen. He engulfs you into the world of Arrakis with the intensity of the drums we've come to love from him and the ethereal romantic love theme of Paul & Chani being instantly memorable. He has done it again and his passion and love for the story, couldn't be more prevalent with his score for the world of Dune and it's intricate characters. The sound mix literally feels like it goes through you in IMAX and right off the bat too as those iconic drum beats start the film. This is a MUST WATCH in IMAX!This film is truly GARGANTUAN all across the board, from the scope, scale, epic war battles, religious context, the moral decisions the characters face & the literal ginormous Sandworms that devour the screen. Filmed for IMAX with the digitally certified cameras (not to confused with 70mm film cameras, albeit there is a 70mm film reel) there is no other way to experience this film (at least on your first viewing) than on the BIGGEST IMAX screen you can get to. Seeing it on a 1.90:1 screen was huge, but I can only imagine what the lucky people who'll see it on a 1.43:1 screen in either IMAX 70mm or dual laser will experience. The fact that there's EVEN MORE image in scenes with up to 40min in 1.43:1 will be such a visual treat. If only Warner Bros & IMAX provided all 30 capable 1.43;1 IMAX theatres like Universal did for Oppenheimer.There are so many scenes & shots that are a cinematic achievement unlike any other. It will need many rewatches to be able to absorb everything displayed, catch certain plot details that may have been missed, but the first viewing is absolutely mind blowing. The scene shown on the IMAX poster with the Sandworms appearing out of the shadows, is truly eye opening and my eyes were already widened in complete awe. The arena scene is essentially Gladiator in space & it is definitely a standout moment. You also really feel like you're there in the arena, when seen on such a large screen. Villeneuve has rocketed through any of the previous bars set before in the genre and it really makes me proud to know that this ingenious filmmaker is Canadian!Without question, Denis Villeneuve has cemented himself as one of the best sci-fi directors of all time with Arrival, Blade Runner 2049, Dune: Part One and now Dune: Part Two being one of the best sequels ever. He has brought everything that he learned from those films into this one and showcased new elements of his craft that solidifies just how much he understands, respects and loves Dune. This film will be a juggernaut and there's no denying that we have yet to see more from the world of Arrakis.\"Long live cinema!\" - Denis Villeneuve.",

What is a 2 hour 40 minute film felt like an hour and a half to me. The storyline along with the otherworldly music grips you in from the very beginning. A perfect sequel to dune part one in that it's so different to part one but the stakes seem much higher. I will be seeing it again tomorrow after seeing it this evening, which is rare for me.Now we can only hope this film does well enough to justify a production of dune messiah.",

    "Review Content": "I do love Sci-fi. I watch so many movies.... But....finally !Denis Villeneuve, thank you so much!This movie is so beautiful, clever and epic. Far better than any sci-fi movie, ever ! And not for kids, for grown ups!Thank you! With full sentences and clever people.Beautiful. Absolutely gorgeous. Ships, costumes, landscapes, weapons.We do all know Dune is not an easy book to work on. It's close to a political essay about ecology and religion. I remember how cautious I was, not so happy about the casting, before watching the first part and I was finally so convinced..\nAnd the second one is even better!WOW ! I'm really blown away!Great great villains in a movie, finally! Not some angry teenage, a \"Darkkevin66\" ! Real psychopaths.BUT, not a white and black situation at all. The \"good ones\" show a dark face too and a very awful one. Fundamentalism. Religious and political manipulations, sneaky moves, very violent issues. I won't spoil that.Go watch this movie.Harkonnens are frightful, Christopher Walken is a great Emperor and I really do like Stilgar.Special mention to Zendaya and Timothy Chalamet.I'm not a big fan of these actors. But :\nZendaya is a real fighter, a rebel who knows well who his lover is, and shows with a very nice self-restrain her concerns and unhappiness. And Timothy Chalamet is really moving, torn between his vision of a dark future, the injonctions of the Fremens beliefs, the manipulations of the Bene Gesserit, her mother (a great vengeful Jessica), and his love for Chani.Never thought I will ever find this actor so moving. I was wrong. Great with sorrow and torn feelings, like with anger and harsh determination.The bad part : too long to wait for the third part and no directors's cut, Denis Villeneuve said.I have to watch it again, at least three or four times.After Blade Runner 2049, Denis Villeneuve show us a sci-fi movie can be a piece of art.",

    "Review Content": "Dune2 is the perfect adaptation of the book and it delivered the best cinematic experience a sci fi movie can deliver.Camera, art, cinematography, VFX all are in the benchmark territory\nThis movie need to be watched from the imax theatre for the best experience.In the vast and unforgiving sands of Arrakis, a tale of power, prophecy, and survival unfolds in the epic adaptation of Frank Herbert's seminal science fiction masterpiece, \"Dune.\" Directed by visionary filmmaker Denis Villeneuve, this cinematic triumph delivers an unparalleled experience, particularly when viewed in the immersive setting of an IMAX theater. As audiences are transported to the far reaches of the universe, they are treated to a visual and auditory spectacle that elevates the already captivating narrative to new heights.From the moment the opening credits roll, \"Dune\" plunges viewers into a richly realized world of political intrigue and ancient prophecy. Villeneuve's masterful direction and Roger Deakins' breathtaking cinematography combine to create a visually stunning landscape that feels both familiar and alien. In IMAX, every sweeping vista of the desert planet Arrakis and every intricately detailed costume and set piece come to life with unparalleled clarity and depth, immersing audiences in a sensory experience unlike any other.At the heart of \"Dune\" lies a sprawling epic that follows the journey of Paul Atreides, played with depth and nuance by Timothée Chalamet. As the young scion of House Atreides, Paul finds himself thrust into a dangerous game of politics and power on Arrakis, where control of the planet's most valuable resource, spice, hangs in the balance. Chalamet's portrayal captures the complex inner turmoil of a young man torn between duty and destiny, as he grapples with his newfound role as the chosen one of prophecy.The supporting cast, including Rebecca Ferguson as Paul's mother Lady Jessica, Oscar Isaac as his father Duke Leto, and Zendaya as the mysterious Fremen warrior Chani, further enriches the tapestry of characters. Each actor brings depth and humanity to their roles, elevating the ensemble cast to new heights and ensuring that even the most minor characters leave a lasting impression on the audience.What sets \"Dune\" apart from other sci-fi epics is its meticulous attention to detail and richly textured world-building. Villeneuve and his team have crafted a universe that feels lived-in and authentic, from the intricate politics of the Great Houses to the customs and traditions of the desert-dwelling Fremen. In IMAX, every minute detail is brought to life with stunning clarity, allowing audiences to immerse themselves fully in the world of Arrakis and its inhabitants.But \"Dune\" is more than just a visually spectacular blockbuster; it is also a thought-provoking exploration of themes such as power, religion, and ecology. Herbert's novel, upon which the film is based, is renowned for its depth and complexity, and Villeneuve does justice to the source material by crafting a narrative that is both faithful to its roots and accessible to newcomers. In IMAX, the film's grand themes are brought into sharp relief, inviting audiences to ponder the nature of destiny and the consequences of our actions on the world around us.In conclusion, \"Dune\" is a cinematic triumph that delivers the perfect IMAX experience. Denis Villeneuve's visionary direction, coupled with stunning visuals and powerhouse performances, creates an epic saga that will leave audiences breathless. Whether you're a fan of the original novel or simply seeking a thrilling cinematic experience, \"Dune\" is not to be missed. Strap in, hold on tight, and prepare to be transported to a world beyond imagination.",

I a faithful believer in Frank's books Herbert but I'm also a believer in Timothee Chalamet and the infamous Austin butler who gives such a scary and terrifying performance throughout the movie that he tramples Sting's performance in David Lynch's work.Jessica chesstein, Florence pug, Stellan Skårsgard and aother actors have managed to show that in this film everyone can shine at any moment in the entire Arraquis desert, but if you made me say who it was that completely stole the show it would have to be Austin Butler with his terrifying presentation and also the fun moments I was able to have with Javier Bardem.The film not only continues to leave us with the most important themes it has, such as politics in the Imperial World of Dune, including religious themes, ecological environmental themes, but it also even handles a somehow spiritual something symbolic something where you are in a desert, you feel that connecting with another essence of life and that is what I perceive when see the Dune part 2, an essence of life so great at an unimaginable magnitude that it causes anyone who immerses themselves in the desert to become become a Fremen.At the end of the day Dune part two will become an important film in the history of cinema either how to make a blockbuster of high magnitude or how to present a good cast, I have a lot of evidence and I can guarantee that I have zero doubts. I hope you can enjoy this movie like I did.",

    "Review Title": "Dune 2 - A science fiction master piece",
    "Review Date": "2024-03-02",
    "Review Content": "Dune: Part One was my favourite movie of 2021. Originally slated to be released in November of last year, this second instalment was delayed due to the SAG-AFTRA strike. So it was with bated breath that I saw it last night in IMAX.Dune 2 is a masterpiece.It has been a very long time since a movie has left me speechless.It is Denis Villeneuve's magnum opus. Very much like how Christopher Nolan crowned his career with Oppenheimer last year, this is Villeneuve's greatest ever movie.Similar to Peter Jackson's, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003), Dune 2 represents another evolution of cinema as an art form. I don't use that word lightly.This is the true definition of a vice movie (see 4 Types of Movies tab at the top of homepage). The story locks you in from the opening frame and at just 15 minutes shy of 3 hours, this movie absolutely flies by, not once during it's runtime was I bored.The only downside is my cinema going adventure's of 2024 has peaked with Dune: Part Two, nothing will compare to this movie for the rest of the year.Let's have a Catch up...The story picks up literally in the same frame as part one ended. Dune: Part One and Dune: Part Two have to be seen as one movie split into two, this is not a sequel. If part one was the starter, this is the main course. It makes the first movie better.Paul Atreides (Chalamet) cements his position on Arrakis. He along with his mother Jessica (Ferguson) who herself becomes the Revered Mother start to foresee a prophecy that Paul or to give him is Fremen name Usul will become the saviour of the planet. To reflect this Paul gives himself the name of Muad'Dib, a powerful name on Arrakis.Meanwhile, after Baron Harkonnen continues to lose his grip on Arrakis thanks to the losses at the hands of those \"Rats\" the Freman and the incompetence of his unstable nephew Beast Rabben (Batista), the Baron calls his beloved other nephew Feyd-Rautha (Butler) up to the plate to re-take the planet in his families name and setting the scene for war.So, the best way to review this movie because of it's immensity is to break it down, here goes..CinematographyEvery aspect of how this movie looks is frankly staggering. DP Greig Fraser not only makes each frame look like a stunning photograph, his use of camera angles, lighting and the natural environment is amazing. The battle scenes are jaw dropping and the sense of scale, especially the sand worms in IMAX is eye watering. I had spine tingles for most of the movie.Sound and ScoreThe sound is incredible, as I saw it in IMAX (which I implore you to do if able) leaves you shaken in your seat. You will never forget where and when you first saw and heard those sand worms. The score by the legendary composer Hans Zimmer is equally superb and is used to amazing effect.CastAs for the cast, each member of the star studied line-up absolutely bring their A game to the table. This movie makes Timothée Chalamet a man. Gone is the petulant son of Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac). I think Chalamet is fast becoming this generation's DiCaprio. Zendaya was equally superb as his partner Chiani, as she continues to show that she is one of the leading actresses of her geneartion.After his breakout role in Elvis (2022) and Apple TV+ series Masters of the Air (2024) Austin Butler is a revelation as the psychopathic Feyd-Rautha, beloved nephew to Baron Harkonnen.No Country for Old Men alum Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem resume their respective roles as Gurney Halleck and Stilgar offering gravitas and wise council to the younger cast who take centre stage.Florence Pugh as the emperors daughter Princess Irulan is excellent as is the great veteran actor Christopher Walken (In a small but pivotal role) as the Emperor.My only \"complaint\" as such is that Dave Batista's character Beast Rabben felt under served and was reduced to a bit of a one note character screaming out orders whilst slipping further out of the good graces of his uncle. On that subject, Baron Harkonnen (Skarsgard) himself so central to the original film is also somewhat side lined in this second part of the movie.ActionWhilst I in no way shared this sentiment, there were some people who said Dune: Part One was boring and lacked action. The same cannot be said for this continuing instalment.The action in this movie is breathtakingly shot and choreographed. Whether it was wide scale battles or hand to hand combat it felt exhilarating, organic and primal.Special EffectsA seamless blend of top drawer CGI and jaw dropping practical effects. Effortlessly combined with filming on location in Abu Dhabi.Impact on CinemaDune: Part One and Dune: Part Two, is this generations Star Wars. It however goes further than that, it is Star Wars for grown-ups. There is nothing Disney has done with Star Wars to rival or even come close to Villeneuve's incredible movie. It makes the recent MCU and DC movies look what they are, light weight tensionless candy floss poop.What Villeneuve has achieved here is simply staggering.It reminds you of why the medium of cinema exists.It is a science fiction masterpiece.Denis Villeneuve and team deserve all the adulation, box office success and awards they can get.Verdict - Unmissable.",

Dune chapter 2 a follow up to Frank Herberts science fiction series definitely lived up to the high expectations set by its predecessor but also exceeded them in every possible aspect. The way the story was told captivated audiences immersing them in a narrative that was both expansive and intimately personal. This installment explored the dynamics of the Atreides family, their allies and adversaries unveiling the politics of the universe with remarkable precision and depth that kept me fully engaged. The themes of fate, environmentalism and human perseverance resonated deeply than before presenting a story that was both stimulating and exciting.",

    "Review Date": "2024-03-03",
    "Review Content": "I wasn't a huge fan of the first part. As a big fan of the books, I thought that they didn't really do enough to build the lore or develop the characters. I thought they concentrated on the wrong elements of the book.I was willing to give the 2nd part a fair chance to correct that. Get things back on track. Its supposed to be an adaptation and part of me does expect the general spirit of the characters to be maintained, even if some of the detail wasnt.Book fans may be disappointed. The writer and director take liberties with the source material, fundamentally changing the nature of a main character. If jars as a book fan to see how they treated Chani. Not only that, but it also makes further Dune movies likely to deviate even further from the source.*spoilers*It was a common complaint that Chani was.little used in the first part of the adaptation. Zendaya appeared fleetingly and had almost no significant input into things. Clearly that's not the case in part 2, but her part in the story is significantly different from the original source.In part 2, Chani seems to switch between loving Paul to telling anybody who'll listen that he's not the messiah and is instead somewhat of a naughty boy. It makes the intimate, romantic stuff seem out of place against her continued effort to undermine the prophecy that he's the voice from another world who'll lead the Fremen to freedom. The 2 sides to Chani really do jar against each other. The romance never feels particularly genuine when she seems to switch from lover to critic in the space of a few minutes of run time.Should that matter? For the movie it possibly doesnt, other than being annoying. But this is the girl who's supposed to be the mother of 3 children to Paul. So to have her storm out of the scene with Princess Irulan and to then end the film with the spurned lover calling a worm to ride alone into the desert has a far bigger negative impact. Book readers know what Chani's role should be. We know what she does in Dune Messiah and how things play out in Children. If there is going to be an adaptation of the 2nd, and maybe even 3rd, books in Herbert's series then Dune part 2 hasn't exactly made it easy to get things back on track. Paul is going to have to do some pretty incredible making up if he;s going to convince the rather detached Chani to be the mother of his kids in time for a potential Messiah adaptation.It's not all bad. The cinematography is great. The sound is fantastic. The scene with Paul addressing the council of naibs is genuinely incredible. His snarling performance in front of his doubters, almost inviting them to challenge him before destroying any of their doubts with his deeply personal knowledge of their history and their ways is one of the finest scenes in recent cinema. Chalamet plays the scene perfectly. Sadly the rest of the movie can't quite reach that high point. The final battlle for Arakeen feels a good few minutes shorter than it should be. The Harkonen character design never feels particularly well done and Beast Raban is more pantomime villain than the guy sent to brutalise the Arakis population.Does any of that matter? If I'd never read the original source material then it probably wouldn't. I'd be a little bit unsure of the character development but I'd probably feel that most of the constituent parts of an epic scifi classic were there. It's a flawed movie, but those flaws probably wouldn't be such an issue as they are for me as a fan of the books.Ultimately the director and writer have told their version of the Dune novel over 2 movies. It's just that the character changes not only fail to help the movie, but they flat out detract from it and it ends up feeling like a wasted opportunity. It could have been better and it could have set the foundation for a generational series of films.",

I will not exaggerate when I say that for me it is a masterpiece that I want to see again and again and again. So the director departed from the canon, the life of the Freemen is not revealed as in the book, but it is Herbert. In my opinion, Villeneuve did everything he could and did it beautifully. As for my favorite actors, Butler is the best for me, to portray Faith Rauta like that, I have gold in my limbs from his cruelty and charisma, it's incredible. The audio work is colossal.

    "Review Date": "2024-03-02",
    "Review Content": "Another visually stunning submission by director Denis Villeneuve that tragically falls short of the mark.The task of translating Herbert's massive literary Dune universe to screen is by no means an easy feat; unfortunately, it is a feat that perhaps does not need to be attempted. The convoluted storyline results in an ill-paced cinematic experience, where parts of the film's 3-hour runtime seem to drag for an eternity, whilst others are skimmed and skipped over. The film leaves too many questions unanswered, and despite its considerable runtime, many characters and plot lines are not afforded enough time to properly develop and shine.The likes of Austin Butler are wasted in this film, with a compelling and interesting character who ultimately has a total of 10 minutes screen time and is swiftly and predictably killed off.The likening of this film's \"epic battle sequence\" to The Lord of the Rings- or indeed any grand cinematic battle sequence of recent decades- is frankly insulting. If you are watching this film with the expectation that the battles will be a transformative cinematic experience, prepare to be disappointed by a 5-minute sequence that ends as swiftly as it begins. Countless more deserving films could be afforded this high praise.The film's present critical and audience reception is by far its biggest weakness, setting expectations that cannot and are not met. The bar needs to be lowered for this film to successfully impress. It's beautiful, and features a stacked cast, but it is not genre-defining, nor is it's script remotely noteworthy. If you are seeking a visual feast of a sci-fi film, the director offers many more impressive submissions.Chalamet fans who are craving a film with noteworthy action sequences that features the actor in a position of leadership and power are better off trying Netflix's \"The King\". For a Hans Zimmer-scored cinematographic marvel featuring a stacked cast including young Chalamet, stick with Nolan's \"Interstellar\".Lower expectations and find the film an adequate cinema experience.",

    "Review Content": "First off, Dune Part Two does justice to Frank Herbert's visions when he authored the book. The complex thoughts and writing from the novel is carried out beautifully as the story switches out between separate planets and settings, and ultimately creating different cinematic experiences every half hour or so.Focusing less on comparisons around the book, Dune Part Two feels unique to the first movie. Regarding their similarities of how Part Two upscales everything that Part One did right (and removed EVERY criticism I had with it), the pacing of Dune Part Two is crafted excellently.Each arc in the story is written and filmed like a Greek Epic, with Timothée Chalamet being your Heracles. Simple dialogues will distract you with beautiful sunsets and brutal battles immerse you with the sense of victory or the pain of loss.I especially was a fan of Austin Butler's performance as one of antagonists and his acting was downright horrific at times, when mere logic causes an advisor to have his throat slit due to Feyd's psychotic tendencies.Chalamet stepping up as a leader in his Hero's Journey is a transcendent experience, as he quickly transforms from bland, intelligent, and strong rich kid to a planning politician with a guide to his goals within his mind. Overall, Paul Atreidus becomes an actually interesting character.This movie had some unintentional comedic moments. The Fremen's reaction to anything that Paul did made my near-entire theater laugh three times.Already, this review is getting very long, but props to Hans Zimmer for creating yet another majestic score for a movie.That's not all I have to say, but you get the picture.",

He's amazing in CMBYN but elsewhere he tends to revert to a Batman voice that muffles all that charisma he has. Paul is not muffled and withdrawn.And to be frank, Chalamet could put on 50 lbs and still be too skinny and weak to play someone who can fight.The movie LOOKS amazing. Stellar. The casting of Chalamet, ZENDAYA AND Pugh left me scratching my head. Both Dukes, Paul's mom, all the Harkonens, great casting and performances.My biggest beef is how much the plot here insisted on an unwilling Messiah, unlike the source material.That and an already meh performance from Chalamet made this the only iteration of the books that i have no desire to watch again.Does not live up to the hype.Felt very GoT finals seasons, as if everyone was trying to get fired from any future installments.",

As I'm watching the new Dune I'm thinking what happened to the spice test for Paul, the background of the WORD as a weapon, missed out on much of Paul's training folding like a leaf, and where is the space folding leadership. These are only a few flaws due to Denis Villeneuve poor handling of the story. I guess in todays world of mediocrity this is a great job by Denis Villeneuve, I would strongly disagree.

Personaly, Ausitn Butler stole the show, but in movie this good, its so hard just to take one component. I knew the story, I red the book, I seen the old Lync movie, and still this one went over all my expectations..Denis, thank you for this amazing work, this is true labor of love! This is how you do justice to source material! Now long wait for 3rd one!",

    "Review Content": "And the power of a brilliant second part is the power to create the best trilogy ever. This film surprised me in ways I didn't think were possible after the first one.The sound design really stands out and creates with the ever-brilliant music of Hans Zimmer the best audio atmosphere I ever experienced. The stunning landscapes and the visually beautiful effects even got better than the first film which many critics also highly praised back then for the effects. Top-notch visuals also in all the fighting scenes, being it explosions or hand-to-hand combat.The way the story is presented felt a bit unusual but the more I think about it, I think that it is the right way to make the film appear as boring. You have to carefully watch and listen to every dialogue or even every line. Otherwise you can miss important information and can become a bit confused later. Lots of deep dives into Fremmen culture and believes. For this reason I highly recommend to watch the first film shortly before.The cast that presents this story part is brilliantly chosen and each and everyone delivers. Timothée Chalamet and Javier Bardem stood out which harmonizes very well with the development of their respective characters.Can't say how amazed I was by every aspect of this film. Maybe the best sci-fi film in the last decade and if Messiah (Part 3) is just as good as this we have the best trilogy ever created in film history.",

This film will fall flat without the grandeur of its score, which heightens each scene to orgasmic proportions. The amount of artistry that went bend this production is unfathomable. An achievement in cinema.Every penny invested in this experience is worthwhile. Films of such caliber emerge once in a decade, so do yourself a favour and make your purse a bit thinner to experience it in IMAX - not for the sake of extravagance, but because Denis Villeneuve envisioned this cinematic marvel to be savored in that format. This isn't a film to be casually torrented and watched at home.",

    "Review Title": "Dune: Part Two is a Cinematic Experience Deserving to be Seen in Theaters",
    "Review Date": "2024-03-06",
    "Review Content": "Following up the critically acclaimed predecessor, Dune: Part Two brings viewers back to the world of Arrakis. Adapting the second half of Frank Herbert's original Dune novel, director Denis Villeneuve set out to decompress the epic story and tell it to its full potential. Fans of the franchise previously enjoyed Villenuve's 2021 reboot Dune, but with it being unceremoniously released mid-pandemic, its HBO Max streaming debut greatly hindered its box office numbers. Fortunately, the triumphant reception of the film demanded a continuation, delivered in Dune: Part Two.After the assassination of his father and the destruction of their new kingdom at the hands of the Harkonnen, Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) is accepted into the desert-dwelling community of the Fremen. Though their ruler, Stilgar (Javier Bardem), views Atreides to be their Messiah, Chani (Zendaya) sees the fallen royal as the man that she loves. While Paul learns the way of the Fremen, Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) calls upon his most ruthless nephew Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler) to aid in the treacherous spice harvest. As the opposing forces assemble, they find themselves preparing for a war for the planet Dune.Dune: Part Two is an extraordinary piece of cinema and admirably continues the story set in motion by the previous installation. Though it starts a bit slow, the tension steadily builds as the plot thickens and revelations are discovered. With each passing scene, the story weaves layers and creates challenges for the characters to overcome both physically, mentally, and philosophically. While it runs longer than the first, there are no wasted moments, and even at a nearly 3-hour runtime, it leaves audiences yearning to dive directly into Dune 3.As one of Hollywood's most prolific rising stars, Timothée Chalamet completely immerses himself in his multi-faceted performance. Throughout the film, Chalamet vividly explores the depths of his character, creating the most memorable role of his career. Standing amongst an exceptionally talented cast, Chalamet rises in caliber and ensures that his name will forever be synonymous with Dune.After finally uniting in the closing moments of Part One, Zendaya's Chani is given much more screen time to flesh out her mysterious character. Keeping pace with Chalamet, she flawlessly balances the constantly shifting emotional journey. Following their journey, Javier Bardem is shockingly humorous and delivers one of the best new characters in the franchise. His over-zealous personality blends with his dynamic performance as he consistently steals his scenes. In its star-studded cast, Dune: Part Two is filled with recognizable faces, although in an alien world, some aren't as easily recognized.Accompanying Stellan Skarsgård's ever-nefarious Baron, Austin Butler joins the cast as the psychotic heir to the throne. While his performance is mesmerizing, Butler's role feels almost redundant alongside the Baron's other nephew, Beast Rabban (David Bautista). Despite Bautista excelling in the first film, he is heavily reduced in the sequel as Butler greatly overshadows his character. Though they're both dastardly and riveting, the villainous family felt as if there could have been more to explore with its existing members, instead of continuing to add foes.With streaming services making it easy to catch the newest releases, Dune: Part Two is a film that is best enjoyed on the biggest screen you can find. Although most of the story takes place on the desert planet of Arrakis, cinematographer Greig Fraser brings Dune to life as every minute detail screams out for attention. The planet, creatures, and environment are uniquely designed and will likely be looked back on as a cinematic masterpiece. Accompanied by a chilling score from the legendary Hans Zimmer, Dune: Part Two is a feast for your senses.Dune: Part Two expertly captures a once deemed 'unfilmable' story. Flawlessly constructed by its cast and crew, every aspect of the film complements each other as they create an unforgettable experience. Akin to the release of Star Wars, Dune: Part Two is truly one of the greatest sci-fi films ever made and likely the greatest of this generation.",

And apart from the last music of the film, I did not find the soundtrack extraordinary.So I think it must be seen, it remains visually very beautiful, and therefore this film must be seen in the cinema to enjoy it, and if possible in Imax Digital since it was filmed in 70mm.Of course, it's a film that must lose intensity on television and therefore seeing it in the cinema seems essential to me. In my opinion, it will not remain a great film.",

This dude was menacing and a standout in this movie.You HAVE to experience this on the big screen in IMAX!

This is a cinematic experience I won't soon forget.This is why we go to the movies.Words cannot describe it.But here goes:MonumentalColossalPowerfulEpicThoughtfulHauntingExceptionalStaggeringTranscendentAbsorbingImmersiveUnrealGnarlyCrazyAudaciousAmbitiousVisceralTechnically immaculateGorgeousEmotionalProfoundI truly don't think there is anything I can say that would do this movie justice. It's both high art and a massive blockbuster. I'll never know what it was like to see The Empire Strikes Back when it first opened in theaters but I imagine Dune 2 comes close. A staggering leap forward from what came before it while also feeling significantly more personal. Brilliant, huge, revolutionary sci-fi. This movie is a generational masterpiece. We are so lucky to be alive to witness this movie. I have never seen anything quite like it before. For years to come, we will all talk about the wonder we experienced when watching this for the first time.Dune Part Two was vindicating. Like, less than five minutes into it, I sunk into my seat and thought \"Ok, it's somehow different (and better) than I imagined.\" It kept that energy the whole film! My mind is scrambled with thoughts, so this review might be all over the place, but regardless the main takeaway is GO SEE DUNE 2! It's the cinematic event of our generation. Believe all the hype you see. It is the realization of everything I've ever dreamed genre filmmaking can accomplish, we haven't had a genre film quite on this level since The Lord of the Rings (or maybe ever). Within the first ten minutes, I knew we were within masterpiece territory. Once we got to the montage with Paul and Chani set to Zimmer's \"A Time of Quiet Between the Storms\" (my personal favourite scene in the movie), I knew the bar had been raised. And by the time we got to the third act, well, I can't even describe the feelings of excitement I had! The third act of Dune Part Two is perhaps the most staggering thing I've ever seen on a screen. I was in tears - I've never experienced anything quite like it in a cinema before! Dune Part Two is truly something special - it is the kind of blockbuster epic we don't see Hollywood make very often these days, and that is worth cherishing. I spent most of Dune Part Two slack-jawed in sheer awe of what was on screen in front of me. This movie is soul-shattering, and yet so exciting!As I was watching the movie I realized in the moment I was likely witnessing cinematic history unfold before me - this film is a generational masterpiece on the level of The Godfather, Lawrence of Arabia, Star Wars and of course The Lord of the Rings. This movie raises the bar to a whole new level - this film stands head and shoulders about 95% of current Hollywood production. I feel so lucky to have experienced a film on this level.Denis Villeneuve's vision is on spectacular display in Dune Part Two, a bold journey that dives deep into the colliding tragedy of love and destiny. The visual language and soundscape are mesmerizing. You could feel the weight of this world sink in. The ensemble of Dune Part Two is wondrous, especially Zendaya and Rebecca Ferguson, who command the screen and communicate so much with a single look. Timothée Chalamet totally raises the bar with his intriguing buildup of character, and Austin Butler relishes in sheer insanity. Everyone involved, from Hans Zimmer and his mesmerizing score, to Joe Walker and his terrific editing, deliver some of their most incredible work. Greig Fraser's cinematography, however, eclipses everything. The way his images characterize the world of Dune is absolutely breathtaking and the meticulous arrangement makes every single shot look like paintings with which I would gladly cover every centimetre of my walls.Dune Part Two is a colossal action epic. The battle sequences don't take up a large chunk of time, but when they arrive, they're incredible. That final standoff between Paul and Feyd... tense doesn't even begin to describe it. This is a beast of a film, rewarding in both the thrilling setpieces and rich allegory. Denis Villeneuve's eye for action and iconography blends for a nearly flawless blockbuster, and an unforgettable cinematic experience. This is a transcendent cinematic masterpiece that demands to be experienced on the largest screen possible. Denis Villeneuve has created one of the best sequels of all time. One of the greatest sci-fi films of all time. Hell - one of the greatest films of all time. This is the Lawrence of Arabia of science-fiction epics.Dune Part Two is triumphant. A masterpiece that has to be seen to be believed. I never wanted this to end. Denis Villeneuve has crafted a brilliant, bleak, and meaningful epic that further proves he's a master of his craft. This is a sequel that takes everything that was great from the first film and somehow manages to improve upon it. And I LOVED the first film. Villeneuve has a deep understanding of Frank Herbert's iconic novel. He understands the world, tone, characters, and ideas, and yet still makes changes where necessary that I found to improve upon the book. Even more immense than the first, but much more intimate - Denis Villeneuve manages to streamline the more alienating second half of the book into a riveting, action-packed epic. For me, the whole occupies a rarified place alongside The Lord of the Rings as the definitive version of a seminal text. I think Denis Villeneuve, along with Peter Jackson, is one of the very few filmmakers to ultimately improve upon the source material. It's a too-rare blockbuster with proper meat on the bone - practically a satire of religious fanaticism at points.So rarely does blockbuster filmmaking feel this personal. You can feel Villeneuve's touch on every frame. It doesn't behave like a typical blockbuster at all. To be honest my favourite aspect of Dune Part Two is how aggressively \"anti-blockbuster\" it is. Every aspect of the standard Chosen One narrative here is filled with portent and dread. The movie doesn't want Paul to become the One. Once he does, even the \"epic final battle\" intentionally feels wrong. This is kind of the hallmark of a great sequel: Upend the audience's expectations and make them feel defeated. It is bleak - perhaps one of the most bleak blockbusters I've ever seen from a major Hollywood studio. You leave the movie feeling very somber. The film also handles its themes and characters with intent and complexity; themes of religious fanaticism, imperialism, colonialism, cultural appropriation, the hero myth exposed, the dangers of a messiah complex, fate vs free will, revenge, and ecology.Dune Part Two is an astonishing sci-fi epic that surpasses Part One in every single way. Denis Villeneuve has realized his dream of adapting Frank Herbert's masterwork to the big screen with the depth and scale it deserves in a tour de force we rarely see anymore. Truly in awe of all its craft from top to bottom and the perfect cast who bring these characters to vivid life. Timothée Chalamet gives one of his most captivating performances to date, certainly his darkest. He commands the screen like never before. Zendaya is the heart of the movie, while Austin Butler relishes in playing pure psychotic evil. But the scariest performance of all might be Javier Bardem who perfectly captures the novel's dangerous message of fundamentalism.In the end, Dune Part Two is a remarkable work of art. It's everything I want from cinema and sets a new standard for what we should expect from our blockbusters. It absolutely blew away my expectations and I can't wait to see it again. I don't have the words to accurately describe just how much I adore this movie. It transports you to a world of pure immersion for 3 hours and the performances are life-altering. I may see this 10 times in theatres. I can't stop thinking of how much I love Dune Part Two and how it fills me with gratitude for what cinema means to me. This is what the movies were made for. This reminds me of why I love movies. We don't get films this good as often as we ought to, so savour it. Never has a movie transported me to another planet like Dune Part Two. It is as immersive of an experience as I have ever had in the theatre and will go down as one of my all-time favourite cinematic experiences. I hope everyone gets an opportunity to see this on the biggest screen possible. There is truly nothing else like it. I LOVE this movie. Not only is Dune Villeneuve's magnum opus; it's the definitive sci-fi epic of a generation. A tragic tale of blind fanaticism and corruption. A spectacular, soulful, awe-inspiring masterclass of aesthetics and mood beautifully echoing Paul's turbulent journey, that left me utterly speechless! I can't believe we are lucky enough to have a movie like this! It left me with this beautiful feeling that I had just experienced something truly special. I teared up realizing that Villeneuve's Dune is real, that I got to see it, and it's a masterpiece.There is before Dune Part Two and there is after Dune Part Two. I don't know if the world is ready for this movie. It is gnarly. It is crazy. It is audacious. It doesn't hold back. Wow. I can't believe it exists. But it does. And it's here! Bring on Dune Messiah!Long live the fighters.Long live Denis Villeneuve.Long live cinema.",

It's worth noting that the plot is fairly complex, and requires a decent recollection of the first film in order to be understood fully (admittedly this is coming from someone who hasn't read the book).The only drawback for me was that some of Paul's and Chani's dialogue got a bit cheesy in the second half of the film, which betrays their characters to an extent imo.

    "Review Content": "I haven't read the novel, so maybe they just followed the plot, but either way, I found that parts of the story line didn't make much sense. Leaving aside the time worn trope of the white savior coming to redeem the backwards, darker skin people, and the evil villain who lacked any depth or redeeming qualities at all, the story generally was reasonable except for the end when the aged emperor, for some unimaginable reason, decides to personally accept a challenge from an upstart leader on a distant (though strategically important) planet by personally going to that planet to crush him. Why would the elderly emperor of galactic empire take such a risk when he could send his army to do it? Also, if anyone could become emperor simply by challenging the existing emperor, there would be constant challenges from the great houses trying to gain the throne. I found that glaringly irrational decision and nonsensical part of the plot difficult to overlook. And despite all the talk of Paul Atreides being some sort of messiah, he didn't actually do anything messianic except survive drinking poison. One final point: as much as I like Christopher Walken, he was terribly mis-cast as the emperor. I just couldn't buy it.The movie was visually quite stunning in parts and the exploration of Paul and his mother's acceptance into the population of the desert people was well done. The battle scenes were really good and didn't look like CGI and the scenes of the people riding the giant worms were great cinematography. The music was way, way over the top. It was very loud and very dramatic, even in scenes that would have been better with more a more subtle musical background. I sometimes it felt like the soundtrack was overshadowing the actors.On the whole it was enjoyable, though it didn't need to be almost 3 hours long. A passable, but not great flick.",

In this version she wasn't even born yet! Chani & Paul were also supposed to have a child together but that wasn't as important as Alia's story line. There were also some more minor plot deviations but for the life of me I don't know how they make Dune Messiah or Children of Dune without St. Alia. I guess we'll see.

It's a continuation of a story rather than an addition of a story - this feels like a natural progression and a natural franchise rather than a crowbarred in cash-grab.The first Dune was a masterclass in world-building. Part 2 really starts to get to the meat of the story - that's probably it's best element, it's plot is solid. It's a complex narrative but one which completely swept me up and made me want to find out more about these characters, this world. It left me wanting more - it's like a good meal. Dune Part 1 was the starter, Dune Part 2 was the main and hopefully Dune Part 3 will be the delicious desert to follow.Dune is Denis Villeneuve's vision. His art. Villeneuve has easily proven himself to be amongst the best directors not only working today but of all time. Not only is he able to create a completely engrossing world, he's able to include brilliant and at times stunning visuals whilst not letting that get in the way of story and character.Dune Part 2 is better than Part 1, and that was already a big challenge. It's easily so far the best film of 2024, I believe it will be on top ten of the year and I can also state that when generations look back on this film they will regard this as one of the best films of the 2020s.",

But in the second installment lost are the sound design, the strong undercurrent of character buildup and the pace that got the viewer in - that made you \"live\" the movie. Villeneuve, having spent 3 hours in Dune:Part 1 building up an entire universe with dazzling believability suddenly rushes through the whole Part 2 to obviously pave the way to a new set of sequels.There is a hectic feeling to the flow of the plot. Villeneuve acts as if he is eager to get to the end. It is a great show-off and you can sense the pride he has in his creation.Character development is lost here. While he allows the young Atreides to mature a little and discover himself, he quickly turns Stilgar into an almost comical, caricaturized fanatic. While trying to enrich the universe with some new players he wastes the good old ones unnecessarily.The visual design is beautiful to behold as ever. May be it is because we have somewhat gotten familiar with them, the impact is less but still there.The sound was one of the strongest aspects of Part 1. Somehow I feel as if it is sacrificed here to make room for more dialogue. And I think it is a great loss.Conclusion to my rant: By any standard this is a good movie. Worthy of a glowing 7 or 7.5 score. However compared to what it could have been, it unfortunately falls short. And it definitely does not deserve a 9.",

    "Review Date": "2024-03-03",
    "Review Content": "Brace yourselves, spice-freaks! \"Dune: Part Two\" isn't just a movie, it's a full-on sensory assault in the best possible way. Buckle up for a wild ride through the desert sands of Arrakis, where the wind whispers secrets, the Fremen fight for survival, and Hans Zimmer's score will have your heart pounding like a thumper in a sandstorm.Director Denis Villeneuve has crafted a visually stunning masterpiece. From the sweeping desert landscapes to the intricate details of the Fremen culture, every frame is a feast for the eyes. The costumes are equally impressive, transporting you to a world both familiar and alien.But \"Dune: Part Two\" isn't just about spectacle. The story picks up seamlessly after the first film, diving deeper into Paul Atreides' complex journey and the political turmoil brewing on Arrakis. The acting is superb, with Timothée Chalamet delivering a powerful performance as the conflicted young heir.Now, let's talk about the soundtrack. Hans Zimmer, you magnificent madman, you've done it again! The score is nothing short of epic, perfectly capturing the vastness of the desert and the intensity of the conflicts. It's the kind of music that makes you want to stand up and cheer, or maybe even ride a sandworm (though we wouldn't recommend it).Is it worth watching? Is the spice melange worth its weight in gold? Absolutely! \"Dune: Part Two\" is a must-see for fans of the first film, sci-fi enthusiasts, and anyone who appreciates exceptional filmmaking. Just do yourself a favor and see it on the biggest screen possible. Trust me, the IMAX experience will leave you breathless.",

    "Review Date": "2024-03-03",
    "Review Content": "Spice may flow freely in the desert, but the narrative in Dune: Part Two feels more like a slow sand crawl. Don't get me wrong, the visuals are breathtaking. Director Denis Villeneuve crafts a world of immense scale and captivating beauty, transporting us back to the harsh yet strangely alluring landscapes of Arrakis. From the sandblasted plains to the colossal sandworms, every frame is meticulously crafted to immerse the audience in this alien world.However, the film's pacing is undeniably slow. While the first half methodically builds the political intrigue and introduces new characters, it can feel like a slog at times. The action sequences, when they arrive, are undeniably impressive, showcasing Villeneuve's mastery of large-scale battles and special effects. But these moments are scarce, leaving the film with a distinct lack of the \"wow\" factor that captivated audiences in the first installment.Overall, Dune: Part Two is a visually stunning film that suffers from a slow-burning narrative. Fans who appreciate the director's meticulous world-building and philosophical themes will likely find themselves engrossed. But those seeking a fast-paced, action-packed blockbuster might leave the theater feeling slightly disappointed. It's a film to be savored for its visual splendor, but be prepared for a slow and deliberate journey.",

Atrocious character development makes it so you have no one to root for or support emotionally. That coupled with a bewildering story that must surely require hours of time to unravel and understand. It tried to follow the books far too closely to make a good film. Bloated run time introduces so many side elements and characters that make it disengaging. Do yourself a favor, save the money. This film might be worth the time once it's on a streaming service. Big miss, hopefully they don't make a third installment.",

Everything works, amazing story, screenplay, script, cinematography, score, actors, the lot, Denis delivers when so many others have failed. The pace of the film was a major plus factor as well, at no point are we left questioning how we have got there, nothing was rushed unlike many other films that feel the need to overload the audience, which for me ruins a film.

Ornithopters and spice mining equipment were awesome. Chani's role, for which Zendaya is a perfect fit, is inflated to the detriment of the overall experience. The end of the movie was really quite disappointing, with Chani making a scene (again), but also in particular that Alia didn't materialise. And the plot to kill Paul with a hidden blade didn't come out either. Christopher Walken is not a good cast for the emperor, which is really sad, as it is such an important role. The Sardaukar were not at all fearsome. Irulan though, in her blandness, was perfect. It would have been nice to emphasise the importance of the spice more, and what all the fuzz around Arrakis is actually about. The cruelty of the Harkonnens is conveyed convincingly, but Feyd is a weak character. Mentats and Guild are missing which is sad. But the focus on the ensuing jihad in the end is a nice touch. Overall, very good but the ending (from where Paul kills the Baron) is really a bit of a fail.",

I do always like to have someone to cheer for and support; I didn't find anyone to get behind until Josh Brolin came back from the dead. Is anyone a good person? Dune likely should be a series, not a feature film. Acting was mostly flat and predictable, along with the whole plot. I haven't read the books, but these feel like a picture insert for the book series, more than stand alone films.

The source material has the respect for the fremen regilious beliefs while also criticising their fantism but in the film it's not balanced well at all.It felt dry perhaps because there was no progress in the elements we were watching! For example, how you summon worm. Okay, we get it . You don't have to show how to summon the over and over without addition of a new angle or adding something to it. The future foreseeing parts just close up shots which seemed pretty dull.Also missed the feeling of being in a place of high temperature there was lots of dust though 😪. Didn't like the BGM that much felt like the same scores has been repurposed and reused from the first movie. The last 40-50 minutes is so good though 👌👌👌. Perfect 🤓.",

    "Review Content": "Denis Villeneuve's much-anticipated Dune Part 2 has finally graced the silver screen, and it does not disappoint. As the second installment in the adaptation of Frank Herbert's timeless masterpiece, this film not only lives up to the hype generated by its predecessor but surpasses expectations, solidifying its place as a cinematic triumph in the science fiction genre.The narrative of Dune Part 2 picks up seamlessly from where its predecessor left off, delving deeper into the intricate political web and interstellar conflicts that define the Dune universe. The film masterfully weaves together complex storylines, introducing new characters while further developing the arcs of familiar ones. Timothée Chalamet's portrayal of Paul Atreides continues to impress, as he navigates the challenges of leadership and his destiny as the Kwisatz Haderach. Chalamet's performance is nuanced and compelling, capturing the essence of Paul's internal struggles with both power and prophecy.One of the standout aspects of Dune Part 2 is its visual spectacle. Cinematographer Greig Fraser's breathtaking shots bring Herbert's vivid and expansive world to life, from the towering sand dunes of Arrakis to the opulent interiors of royal spaceships. The attention to detail in the production design, coupled with Hans Zimmer's haunting and atmospheric score, creates an immersive experience that transports the audience to the heart of the Dune universe. The film's visual effects are nothing short of groundbreaking, seamlessly integrating fantastical elements with the raw, desert landscapes of Arrakis.Villeneuve's directorial prowess is evident throughout Dune Part 2, maintaining a perfect balance between action sequences and moments of quiet introspection. The film is relentless in its pacing, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats while still allowing for emotional resonance. The intricate choreography of battle scenes is a testament to the filmmakers' commitment to authenticity and detail, making each confrontation a visceral and memorable experience.The ensemble cast of Dune Part 2 is nothing short of stellar. Zendaya's portrayal of Chani continues to captivate, bringing depth and strength to a character pivotal to the unfolding narrative. Oscar Isaac and Rebecca Ferguson, as Duke Leto Atreides and Lady Jessica, respectively, deliver powerful performances that add layers to the familial dynamics at the heart of the story. New additions to the cast, including Javier Bardem as Stilgar and Charlotte Rampling as Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, seamlessly integrate into the established ensemble, enriching the film's tapestry with their own compelling characters.The thematic richness of Dune Part 2 is another highlight, exploring timeless concepts such as power, destiny, and the consequences of choices. The film delves into the complexities of politics, religion, and ecological sustainability, elevating it beyond a mere sci-fi spectacle to a thought-provoking exploration of human nature and society.One of the film's strengths lies in its willingness to embrace the ambiguity and complexity inherent in Herbert's source material. Dune Part 2 does not shy away from the moral gray areas of its characters or the intricate political machinations of the universe. This commitment to authenticity results in a narrative that is intellectually engaging, leaving ample room for interpretation and discussion.In conclusion, Dune Part 2 stands as a cinematic achievement that transcends the boundaries of its genre. Denis Villeneuve and his team have crafted a film that pays homage to Frank Herbert's legacy while pushing the boundaries of visual storytelling.",

Then we rejoiced when it was, and waited eagerly for the second half of the epic story. And after all that time, plus an extra four months resulting from the writers' and actors' strikes, it's finally here. And it was worth waiting every second for.Dune: Part Two is a staggering achievement. Villeneuve's direction on point as always, but his visionary realisation of the books is remarkable. From huge brutalist arenas to seas of desert sand, all beautifully shot by Greig Frasier at the top of his game. Particularly, shooting the monochrome sequence in infrared was a genius move and creates a deeply unsettling atmosphere for introducing Austin Butler's antagonist.Speaking of, the entire cast are in flying form, both new additions and returning favourites. Chalamet's descent from the calm and reserved Paul to the erratic warlord is a remarkable performance, as is the sinister turn from Rebecca Ferguson. Fellow showstoppers include the aforementioned terrifying Butler, the devout extremist from Javier Bardem and Zendaya's uncertainty with her place in the future.Being essentially the second and third acts of the novel, Part Two is naturally more action oriented than the first entry. In that regard they feel very different to each other, but both feel equally necessary in their respective executions. Part One's meticulous world-building and character set-up is expertly paid off throughout Part Two and feels intensely rewarding.A cinematic phenomenon in every sense of the word. A cautionary tale on idolisation. The corruption of morality in the face of absolute power. The escalation of warfare fueled by cultural belief. The betrayal of heritage in forging a new path.The false prophet playing God.See it.Bring on Dune Messiah.",

Although it has a longer runtime (like interstellar) the movie was never boring at all. There's so much to the Dune plot that it's almost hard to catch all in one sitting. There is just so much to digest with this movie, the plot and character development is on spot in every scene. Easily had some of the best acting from the lead characters and did an amazing job making the audience wanting more from every person.

Many of the subplots can be linked with the dangers of religious fanaticism, betraying loved ones for political gains etc and can be applied to today. Maybe Frank Heubert was a visionary who knew where the world is heading. But I could also be wrong as I haven't read the novels yet. The books were writen before star wars came out. So I'm not sure if George Lucas had inspiration from these novels. Nevertheless one should not miss this movie as I was born in late 80's and never had chance to witness lord of the rings in cinema.

I must say, the film impressed me; it's a true masterpiece, especially following the incomplete first film.The film begins with Paul and Lady Jessica joining the Fremen at the end of the previous film. The Fremen consider Paul a messiah, and they aim to make Lady Jessica a Reverend Mother, giving her the Water of Life. However, due to Lady Jessica's pregnancy, it affects the unborn child, and they start communicating. Meanwhile, Stilgar, the leader of the Fremen, is training Paul. However, despite the extensive training section in the book, it was rather brief in the film - it could have been longer.After the training, Paul rides a sandworm, completing his education. Paul and the Fremen then begin their attack on the spice refineries of the Harkonnen Dynasty. During the conflict, they encounter Gurney Halleck, his father's commander and trainer, who reveals the existence of atomics, stating that only Paul can activate them due to his genetics. Paul is now widely regarded as a prophet, and his fame is spreading.While Paul and the Fremen are engaged in these activities, we are introduced to the Emperor and Princess Irulan. The princess suggests that Paul could ascend to the throne after her father, and the Emperor mentions Feyd-Rautha, hinting at his potential.Feyd-Rautha, the insane nephew of Baron Vladimir, is introduced, showcasing his ruthless acts in gladiator arenas. After his brother's failure, Baron Vladimir grants him power, and he initiates an attack on the Fremen sanctuaries.At this point, Paul, following his mother's request, drinks the Water of Life, gaining the ability to see the past and the future. He sees his sister, played by Anya Taylor-Joy - a surprising revelation. Paul then falls unconscious, and Zendaya's character appears, engaging in nonsensical dialogue and shouting at Lady Jessica.When Paul awakens, he has become a true Messiah who knows everything, and everyone now obeys him. Emperor Shaddam arrives, holding Baron Vladimir accountable. A war ensues, with Paul and the Fremen attacking. Baron Vladimir seeks help from other major houses, but the battle scene, although visually stunning, is short and could have been more substantial.Paul arrives and kills Baron Vladimir. He informs the Emperor that he will become the new ruler by marrying his daughter. The Emperor is restrained but helpless. A conflict arises between Paul and his cousin Feyd-Rautha for control of the empire. Despite sustaining severe injuries, Paul kills Feyd-Rautha. When Paul attempts to kill the Emperor, the Princess intervenes, stating, \"The father's blood has been shed,\" and Paul kisses the Emperor's feet.Paul instructs the other houses to destroy spice refineries and submit. When they refuse, Paul declares war, initiating inter-house conflicts.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the film, especially as it successfully concluded the unfinished story from the first installment. The narrative was compelling, although it left some aspects unexplained, assuming viewers were familiar with the books. The film's initial inspiration from the Mahabharata and other myths added to its appeal. As for Hans Zimmer's music, he once again delivered a masterpiece; the theater experience enhanced the already excellent soundtrack. The screenplay and story were exceptional, making it one of the best cinematographic experiences I've witnessed. Denis Villeneuve's direction was impeccable, and the visual direction was also praiseworthy. In conclusion, the film ties up the story of the first film and sheds light on the potential for a third installment. The music and cinematography are outstanding, making it a must-watch in theaters. In a word, it's a masterpiece.",

I have enjoy the first part more.The problem I have with the movie is that despite its length it seems to be cramming too many events into the movie and you have a feeling you are constantly skipping ahead from one point to the next without the proper buildup to achieve the significance of some key events which on the other hand is interesting considering the length of the movie. There is also a lot of talking in this movie and not much action, basically action scenes are over quickly and there isn't much buildup to the last battle which again is over so ridiculously quickly and all the duels also are over so quick so I just couldn't immerse myself or feel the significance of things happening on screen because it was like a speed run of many events which I hate. Napoleon movie for example had this exact same issue for me.Main character also has many \"Looking cool walking, doing nothing important\" scenes that I am not a fan of.Overall it is in no way a bad movie, it is a good movie but it is in no way a masterpiece in my opinion.",

    "Review Content": "I really enjoyed my time seeing dune part two, what an incredible movie to see in theaters. The cinematography, soundtrack, acting, and writing are all top notch. My only gripe as a big fan of the books was missing characters like Thufir Hawat, Count Fenring, and most importantly Alia. I felt that was a bit of a cop out considering they'd have to find a child actor which would be more difficult for them, but I think it would've worked well having a child actor with Anya Taylor joys voice. I found her killing the baron with the gom jabbar in the novel to be much more impactful than Paul killing him. However, with the almost 3 hour run time it is filled to the brim with great story, intense action, beautiful views, and great characters. It's crazy that with two movies there still didn't seem to be enough time to handle every part of the book but like with most adaptations things have to be simplified. Some scenes though were word for word exactly like the book. If there weren't a few missing characters and scenes I would've liked to have seen this would be a 10/10 for me. I thought it near perfectly captured Dune and completed and exceeded what it set out to do. This was truly the best movie I've seen in theaters, it's great on a big screen.",

    "Review Content": "I am massive fan of the book. And I was expecting him to take some artistic liberty. And he took a lot. But somehow it works. Now I am massive fan of his work as well.Look at it in the same way as Lord of the Rings. A lot of things had to be changed or streamlined. And lot of things had to be omitted completely. Although I've missed a lot of things that I was hoping to see and I was very afraid that sucha complex and unique story will not work without all the intricate details that Herbert bestowed upon us in the books. But somehow ... it works. I think this is ultimately the best version that silver screen can receive. It's digestible and understandable for people that never read the books, yet satisfying and full of fan service for those who did.Throughout the whole movie I never stopped having goosebumps. All the time. Nonstop.Soundtrack is 10/10. Can't praise the movie enough. It will create new bar for the future sci-fi projects. I hope Denis Villeneuve will tackle rest of the books as well. And I have high hopes that I'll be satisfied in the same way as I am now.Watch it in IMAX if you can. It deserves it.To all the Dune fans out there ... To all of us who were waiting for this for most of our lifes, pretty much since we've finished the book for the first time. It happened. It's a reality.",

    "Review Content": "I would have given it a very low rating if it hadn't picked up the pace in the last half hour and ended in a satisfying way because the pace of the first 2 hours of the movie was slow enough to push my tolerance limits. Not much was added to it compared to the first movie and I think I liked the first movie more. I was expecting to see more action in the second movie. Although this was a good movie on its own, overall it was not a good sequel that met my expectations and that's why I don't think it was worth the 3 year wait. In the third and final movie, I hope the story picks up pace because I'm bored of listening to 3 hours of bland characters dialogue in limited locations in the desert.",

    "Review Content": "I really enjoyed the movie however the compressing of time and scenes during Paul's assent in the desert felt to rushed. I couldnt help but think this story would have worked MUCH better as a tv series spread out over 2 seasons.If they really focused more on Jessica gaining power in the south, Paul turning into a leader in the North and Feyd's take over of Giedi Prime the end would have been so much more powerful. Florence Pugh, who i would argue is the best actor is given such a flat role and Austin Butler (who i think is the worst actor of the central cast) steals the show.Most of all i think i was a victim of the hype. Constantly hearing \"best sci-fi film of all time\" and even one of the \"best films of all time\" really set unrealistic expectations even as nest i tried to tune it out.",

But some things I loved in the first movie were pretty annoying here. For instance, I grew tired of everybody using the Voice on everybody, this just didn't produce the same effect as in the first part. And come on, the ending, really? Why introduce Alya at all when her role is reduced to that of a talking embryo? Even Lynch did her better justice. And why this series of rushed bald baddie executions? Did you need Part Three to wrap things up properly?",

My boyfriend and I were in awe walking out of the theater, we saw it playing again right after our showing and both didn't hesitate to buy tickets to see it again the same night. The music is incredible, acting phenomenal, visual effects are out of this world, cinematography is absolutely insane. Dune is such a rich story and the universe Frank Herbert created is so incredible. Nothing about it is really like our world; everything from the weapons to the equipment to even the characters is nothing like Earth. It's so unique and fantastic and Part 2 really drives that home. One of the best sequels I've ever seen - people were literally on the edge of their seats watching the entire movie. Never was there anything that didn't have a purpose or felt like filler, and yet it's almost 3 hours long. Absolutely recommend this movie for ANYONE old enough to understand and enjoy it.",

I was immersed in the world of Dune and I definitely want this story to continue to be told through the next book. Denis Villenueve has to be at the helm if they make more. The cinematography by Greg Frazier is awe inspiring. The acting is phenomenal. Hans Zimmer killed it with the score. When the movie ended I was not ready to be done. I wanted more. It was a glorious cinematic experience.Knowing the book material and growing up with the 1984 movie, my only hang ups are on some of the choices of what was left out or changed. I know not everything can fit into the movie but I'm still digesting the changes. Like I said it was an enthralling experience and in some ways they found a very stripped down way of portraying just enough that I'm not disappointed. But I want more! But I do stand by this adaptation of part 1 and now part 2.\"He who controls the spice controls the Universe",

    "Review Title": "Best Book Adaptation of All Time",
    "Review Date": "2024-03-02",
    "Review Content": "This movie, in my opinion, is one of the culminations of the single best book adaptations of all time and I mean this in the strictest sense of ADAPTATION. No book-film pairing can ever surpass the LotR trilogy as an overall unit and how it turned a masterpiece into a masterpiece. In contrast, Dune 1 & 2 turns a great book (that in my opinion lags a few times too many) into a cinematic masterpiece. Did it diverge from the books in some pretty large ways? Yes. As opposed to many instances in adaptation I believe it helped drive the character conflict and the narrative while avoiding the necessary exposition it would have taken to make the cut stuff make sense, all in the context of sub 6 hours of screen time. Peter pushed the LotR trilogy to rewrite the narrative of the films to be Frodocentric and I think Denis did a similar thing specifically in this movie and turning it Paulcentric, and you might be saying well the book is pretty Paulcentric but it focuses that on his inner conflict and conflict with Chani in a way that was more distinct than the book.As an aspiring writer, I was brought to tears thinking of how I would give anything for people to sit in a theater and feel a fraction of what I just felt if I would ever be so lucky for my stories to get adapted. That alone kindled a great sense of urgency and determination in my craft. It's hard to ever say what an author would feel about a film adaptation, but I think regardless of how Frank would feel this duo of films did more than justice to the source material.",

    "Review Content": "When filmmaking gets up for a respectable comeback, being creative and beautiful, you get a product like Dune 2. This film is a masterclass in vfx, sound design, cinematography with good direction and some intense editing.The film closely follows the events of the first film, depicting the journey of Paul Atreides as he becomes part of the Fremen culture uniting with them as they go to war for Arrakis.The movie surpasses the first film in almost every aspect technically. The overall pacing felt a bit slow but wasn't draggy like the first and complimented the atmosphere of the film well. The movie builds tension from the start and peaks strongly towards the end, it has more action than part one. There is some lacking in the emotional resonance from some of the characters but it expands on the lore, develops the main characters and introduces new ones.The visuals were absolutely stunning. This alone sparks a collision of action and adventure in this film astronomically. The camera work constructs a world that gives a deep sense of realism. Almost every frame in this film is detailed and captivating. It's a must watch in 4K Atmos and there are several recommending this to be experienced in IMAX.The score was mesmerizing, clamorous in nature with satisfying highs and lows. Hans Zimmer's smart and vibrant composition adds a lot of weight to the film. The sound was incredible especially of the weaponry. One of the standout elements of this film is its quiet moments which bring strong emotions, pause time before metaphoric events enhanced by remarkable soundtracks and rich cinematography.Most of the characters were acceptably written. Chalament is real, Butler tries to steal the show with Zendaya, Rebecca, Skarsgard, Pugh, Walken, Bardem, Brolin all doing their parts well.Denis Villeneuve excels. He's so good in making big budget epics such as these as there are only a handful of filmmakers today that can handle this genre as skillfully as he can. Blade Runner 2049, Arrival are some of his peak filmmaking and Dune 2 comes real close to fulfillment. Raw image and sound. That's what he delivers.Dune 2 is one of the most spectacular and entertaining sci-fi sequels of the 21st century. For fantasy sci-fi fans this one's a near masterpiece. Among many, Hollywood is known for making sequels most of which are average at best. Times have been changing with films now producing worthy sequels and this is one of them.",

    "Review Content": "This film excels in all the areas that matter. The production is unparalleled, but more importantly, it has the direction, cinematography, and performances to back it up. The story holds fairly true to the book; the deviations present are justified and do not alter the questions posed by the book. Every aspect of this film works together to provide an extremely engaging adventure and, for those who care to delve further, an exceptionally detailed case study in sociology. Simply put, this is an epic.Javier Bardem and Rebecca Ferguson give standout performances here. That said, there are no performances in this film that lack true service to their characters. The themes tackled are poignant, relatable, and well worth contemplating. The age-old story of being torn between duty, love, and personal desire is the crux of Paul Atreides' journey in Dune Part Two. Timothee Chalamet's range is showcased throughout this film, with Paul's evolution from a dutiful son to becoming his own person. Director Denis Villeneuve elicited great, confronting, and honest acting portrayals from all actresses and actors involved.This is a film that will stay with you long after it is over.Please watch.",

    "Review Content": "In the realm of cinematic brilliance, Denis Villeneuve emerges again as an absolute filmmaking genius with Dune: Part Two. Crafted for the expansive expanse of IMAX with Dolby Atmos, this cinematic marvel delivers an unmatched immersive experience, scoring a commendable 9/10 rating from my viewpoint. Villeneuve's vision transports audiences to the majestic landscapes of Arrakis, enveloping them in a world of visual splendor and sonic depth that defies description.At the heart of this epic saga lies the flawless performances of its cast. Timothée Chalamet's portrayal is a revelation, his nuanced acting and impeccable line delivery infusing the narrative with emotional resonance and depth. Austin Butler's commanding presence adds a layer of menace, showcasing his prowess as a versatile actor who commands the screen with ease.Yet, amidst its soaring heights, \"Dune: Part Two\" stumbles slightly with a jarring misstep - the out-of-place slap scene. This singular moment disrupts the otherwise seamless flow of the film, discordant with the subsequent musical score cue. While it serves as a minor flaw, it tempers the film's otherwise impeccable execution.In conclusion, Dune: Part Two captivates audiences with its grandeur and storytelling prowess, a testament to Villeneuve's mastery of the craft. Despite its VERY minor imperfection, the film resonates deeply, promising multiple viewings upon its digital release. It stands as a testament to the enduring power of cinema and secures its place among the pantheon of unforgettable cinematic experiences.",

    "Review Content": "Dune: Part II picks up immediately where the first film ended. It's a straight continuation of Part I and therefore doesn't necessarily have a standout identity of its own (like a Star Wars, or Harry Potter film), which is a perfect approach to it given that both films are basically two halves of one book.It's an epic follow-up, a mastery of filmmaking, imagery, ambience, sound and all sorts of technicalities. You can't help but feel mesmerised by what you are seeing and hearing, and its sense of wonder is unmatched when compared to most films nowadays.The acting in general is superb - but more on that later. The film feels a bit sluggish at times though, and maybe it could have been shortened for pacing purposes. One of Dune - Part II's biggest drawbacks is the lacklustre chemistry between Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya, which makes the Paul/Chani dynamic not very interesting or believable. In fact, Zendaya gives an extremely wooden performance and is clearly outacted by everyone else. She brings down the scenes she is in and her acting seems like it would be more appropriate in a teen flick than in the epic story that is being told here; she lacks nuance, versatility and presence and one wonders if she was cast mainly due to appeal to her social media followers as opposed to any acting prowess. It's not as apparent in the first film as she barely does have anything to do there, but here it's painstakingly obvious and Villeneuve mistankingly focussed much of the second film on her, and she isn't able to carry it. Chalamet is very good, but he sounds at times perhaps too american (same for Zendaya), as if you could pinpoint where he comes from, thus breaking the illusion a bit - it would have been great if a dialect coach had been hired to neutralise their accents, speech patterns and inflections a bit.Aesthetically the film is top notch, though Florence Pugh's looks are a bit questionable at times, especially the first one as it looks more like she is in New York Fashion Week than in an alien world. On the other hand, everything about Feyd-Rautha is fantastic and his scene in the arena is hypnotic, rivalling the iconic one in Gladiator. However, his final clash with Paul Atreides at the end of the film isn't that much better than the one in the 1984 film, and you can't help but think that it could have been more climatic given everything else that preceded it.Dune: Part II proves again that Dennis Villeneuve is one of the best filmmakers ever and after Arrival, Blade Runner 2049, Dune: Part I and now Part II back to back you can't help but anxiously wait for whatever it is he comes up with next!Part I is slightly better mostly due to pacing and perhaps the part of the story being told, but there is no doubt that Dune: Part II is unmissable and one of the greatest sci-fi films of all-time.",

They did things as if I belonged to them, and on top of all of this the scenes are great and the angles make you feel ecstatic. The opening scene is terrible and the ending scene is beyond excellent. An epic movie. The action is new and the method of fighting is unfamiliar. There are some light comedic scenes, but they really made me laugh, and the IMAX experience is truly awesome.

    "Review Date": "2024-03-05",
    "Review Content": "The magnificent Dune saga continues in this eagerly anticipated second chapter from visionary director Denis Villeneuve, one of the best directors working today. Part Two sees Paul Atreides, played by the veritable Timothee Chalamet, embracing his destiny as leader of the Fremen people on the desert planet of Arrakis in exile from the villainous Harkonen family who had betrayed and murdered most of his Royal family in Dune Part One to gain control of the sought after \"spice\", found only on Arrakis, which makes it possible for longer lifespans in human beings, fuel for ships, and other important uses. Or something like that, I'm just going off what I remember from Part One, having not read the book beyond like 50 or 100 pages a long time ago.Part Two depicts complications in Paul's destiny and fairly interesting changes in his character and his mother as well. It's always appreciated in this day and age to see the tried and true hero's journey subverted a bit in a big blockbuster sci-fi/fantasy epic. The acting is great all around despite the sort of cold and alien nature of all these proceedings, but the spell gradually works on the viewer and the humanity comes through, pretty much. I was surprised it ended the way it did and was expecting more of a conclusion, but there was obviously plenty of story progression and so much visual goodness to experience following Part One, which was basically perfect until the conclusion petering out. This one ends in a more rousing way, but similarly in the sense of leaving you wanting more. And I know there're multiple Dune books and maybe the first one didn't end with finality, but when I heard Part One adapted the first half of it and this the second, I had expected more of an ending, especially since a third film will be years away. I can't help but wonder if this should've been like a Game of Thrones style show, instead of a movie every few years. But Dune Part Two is a spectacle to behold and one of the best science fiction films in years.",

    "Review Content": "The part one of this movie had come out during the worst times of covid and I wasn't able to watch it in a theater and I didn't watch it later, on streaming, either. That's why I don't feel super comfortable reviewing this movie, but I couldn't resist to make a few comments, especially about how to make adaptations.When it comes to make a movie based on someone else's vision, a filmmaker needs to be very careful where he/she has room for creative license and where he/she hasn't. If something that was written in the story looks comical on screen, that might mean the filmmaker is having difficulty understanding the writer's vision, or it might just mean that that particular thing doesn't look good on screen. Either way, I am a proponent of excluding these sort of parts, as long as it's not something crucial to the original story and the artist's vision. Of course, there are better examples of adaptations, perfect ones, like The Lord of The Rings movies. The reason I wanted to bring it up in the context of this movie in particular is because there is a contrast to this film, in the form of that old David Lynch movie. People hate me for dissing that movie and I agree that there are some interesting stuff in it, but it is nowhere near redeeming that movie. And one can also argue that Villeneuve's movie is crafted for a mainstream audience, that can also be true, but that is not an excuse for making a comical movie in my opinion, to avoid satisfying a mainstream audience, by itself, should not be the goal, nor does it justify making a comical movie...Dune: Part Two is a visually good, coherent movie. I don't think it's a masterpiece as many people claim, but it's a really good movie. I can understand the difficulties of explaining some of the concepts from the book to a mainstream audience, most of which hasn't read the book. It should have been a trilogy in my opinion, with more scenes of the characters like the Emperor, Feyd and I think Count Fenring was missing altogether, though I am not sure, maybe he was in the first one? Anyways, it wasn't perfect, as I said, but it didn't make a mockery of the novel. Also, keep in mind that this review is from the viewpoint of someone who hasn't seen the part one.",

Dune is based on Frank Herbert's sci-fi novel, but in this combo, it speaks about politics, the use of religion as a political tool for manipulating the masses, it delves into ecology, and within all that, it intertwines the romance of Paul Atreides and Chani, which challenges politics and the empire. It's a story that demands an extremely complex adaptation for a film that, combining both parts, runs around 340 minutes, but Denis Villeneuve managed to capture the essence of Frank Herbert's literary work and gave us the best sci-fi film in history.",

It adheres to the book plot pretty well, but unfortunately it focuses to much in the action sequences, as many sequels tend to do, instead of focusing more on the characters and therefor I feel it gets way to simplified. The brutality of the villains in most parts cliché and doesn't feel genuine at all. There is much more to dig into in the relationship between Paul and the mother as well as Paul and Chani. All in all it is a good enough film, but it could have been much more. It would be a sad affair if a sequel to this follow the same track.",

    "Review Content": "This was an excellent film that cannot be denied. However, I do find myself left a little bit confused as to how a film can be so long and yet have the characters changing their minds in what feels like a split second. Admittedly I have not read the books and may suffer from a lack of understanding because of that. It does seem that Paul went from wanting to do the right thing and be an honourable hero to quite quickly choosing to go south and follow his mother's way. I do also feel like more could have been made of him grappling with the idea of drinking the \"worm piss\" that is for sure. It seems like he is just totally fine with it with little to no consideration. I do feel that Chani also changes her mind about Paul way to quickly in my opinion.Overall it was very cool I must admit. One of the most beautifully shot films I have seen in the cinema since Christopher Nolan's Tenet. The performances are great, especially, Javier Bardem and Austin Butler.A film I would recommend for sure.",

    "Review Date": "2024-03-05",
    "Review Content": "Frank Herbert's (and to a lesser extent his son Brian Herbert) books are literary masterpieces. I have read all of them many times over the years and have never felt bored.The Sci-Fi channel's adaptation of the books (made in the year 2000) is marvellous. It remains fairly true to the books and hence extremely watchable, repeatedly even. The successor series, Children of Dune, is not half-bad either. All with a star cast of not so well known actors, barring very few exceptions who are quite famous. And that series gets a rating of 6.9 while this trash movie gets 9, wow!The first movie was quite good, the plot remained quite faithful to the books and overall, I looked forward to the second and maybe more instalments with some degree of anticipation.But somewhere along the way, the decision to turn the multi-faceted epic to a space opera seems to have been made.A few glaring divergences lead us to this travesty of a movie.No mention of Dr. Liet Kynes in this movie, so some mystical mumbo-jumbo of greening.No mention of Kanly, so the seriousness of the Paul-Feyd fight is dumbed down to a grudge match. Also, no Atreides gom Jabbar for the Baron Harkonnen.The Bene Gesserit are reduced to one dimensional characters. Their only \"superpower\" is Voice. No mention of their \"weirding ways\". Their superior training leading to control over their body chemistry which is a critical component of the Water of Life transformation is glossed over to such an extent to be almost absent.The whole Imperial setup is laughable. If the few images of Corrin are supposed to be representative, no wonder Shaddam is so pitiable a character. And let's not look at the caricatures that are the Sardaukar.Lastly, what's with the exclusion of the Spacing Guild in this movie? After all, they were there in the first movie, albeit as minor characters. In the books, they were described as the third of a triad of political forces, the other two being the Emperor and the Great Houses. Without them, the climax sequence in this movie is greatly reduced. If you don't believe me, please take a look at the same scene in the Sci-Fi adaptation. Now that one is class all the way!Overall, the only charitable conclusion I can make here is that this is a movie that borrows the title, the names of the characters and seemingly little else from the titular books. It definitely doesn't borrow the plot to any great degree, so this ends up being a boring pace opera.",

    "Review Content": "A very sad story about manipulation of the vulnerable and weak minded individuals by the powerful, to make self fulfilling prophecies become reality. Though the story is fictional, it uses Arab stereotypes and terms, thereby clearly falsely implying that this is somehow what Arabs are like. In addition to this, the West have done this very thing in the Middle East for decades and as a result we are seeing conflict after conflict take place. Therefore my own recommendation for those seeking to learn about a real life conflict is either to read books or watch documntaries by John Pilger or Robert Fisk instead. Alternatively, watch a better film like Lawrence of Arabia or anything by Egyptian director Mustapha Akkad.The cinematography was great (I liked the black and white scenes with Austin Butler), but at 2 hours and 47 minutes runtime it is very long, boring and tedious.",

She brings such depth and emotion to the character, making Chani feel like a real person you can root for and connect with. Her chemistry with Timothée Chalamet is off the charts, and you can feel the tension and tenderness between them in every scene they share.Zendaya's presence on screen is captivating, and you can't help but be drawn into her world. She's not just an actress playing a role; she becomes Chani, embodying her strength, courage, and vulnerability in a way that's truly inspiring.And let's not forget the rest of the movie - the visuals, the storytelling, everything is just top-notch. Director Denis Villeneuve has created a breathtaking world that feels both epic and intimate, and Zendaya's performance is a shining beacon in the midst of it all.Overall, Dune Part 2 is a cinematic experience you won't soon forget, and Zendaya's talent and charisma only add to its brilliance.

    "Review Date": "2024-02-29",
    "Review Content": "Dune: Part Two had a lot to do: Part One spent nearly three hours creating questions and setting up plot lines and Part Two has the challenge of bringing them all together. Asides from the in-universe questions, there were external concerns that the film had to field. Many, including myself, found the first movie to be well made but a bit hollow upon first viewing. Both the crew and the actors did well, but they occasionally seemed to show signs of struggle in terms of managing the weight of the admittedly very heavy source material. Part Two ends up doing a nice job at fielding these questions and winds up creating a well made sequel that not only improves on the first, but expands its ideas and makes them more coherent. Every aspect of the first film is done better in the second, from the visuals to the handling of the story: the transformation of Paul Atreides into Muad'Dib is done beautifully and is anchored by a strong performance from Timothée Chalamet. The connection between Paul and Chani is written and performed very well and the introductions of the new characters, such as the Emperor and Feyd-Rautha Harkkonen are executed smoothly. The movie seems to be much more confident in its direction than the first and that makes for a more compelling watch because the audience feels that confidence and can lose itself more easily in the on-screen universe. Technically, the film is jaw dropping and occasionally had me wondering how they managed to film some scenes. The Imax experience is extremely rewarding and I get the feeling that I maybe wouldn't have enjoyed the movie as much if I had seen it at home. The big question surrounding this movie, as well as all adaptations is, how does it compare to the original book? The film does make some big choices, particularly in regards to Alia Atreides, but I can't see how they could have managed to make the film more of a loyal adaptation without sacrificing some of its quality. So while the film may not replace the books, they are, in my opinion, a very good companion piece and a worthy adaptation. I look forward to Part Three and I am very grateful to Mr Villenueve for spearheading this project and bringing this story to life.",

No one can deny how epic his special effects are.

I want to worship him for 2 hours and 46 minutes, just like his followers. Be intimidated by Stellan, the blob-dictator and his albino people.

Rebecca Ferguson shines as Lady Jessica, showcasing her fierce loyalty and unwavering determination. The supporting cast delivers equally strong performances, with standout moments from Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem, and Zendaya.The film's pacing is deliberate, allowing viewers to fully immerse themselves in the intricate plot and richly developed characters. While some may find it slower than Part One, the deliberate build-up culminates in a series of breathtaking action sequences that are both visually awe-inspiring and emotionally impactful.The visual effects are truly phenomenal, pushing the boundaries of cinematic technology. From the vast sand seas of Arrakis to the majestic sandworms, every frame is a visual feast. The score, once again by Hans Zimmer, perfectly complements the visuals, heightening the film's emotional core.While \"Dune: Part Two\" may not be a perfect film, it is a significant achievement in filmmaking. It is a thought-provoking and visually stunning spectacle that will stay with you long after the credits roll.

    "Review Date": "2024-03-03",
    "Review Content": "This is a long review. So, thanks in advance for reading. Even if no one ever reads this I need to get the thoughts out of my head.I will give my background hopefully to inform the perspective of my review.Dune is my favorite book, and I re-read it every other year or so and have done for the past 30+ years. The quality declines quickly after the first book, but the first book is a masterpiece. It is the best singular work of fiction in my opinion. Every time I read it; I discover something new.In addition, I am a huge fan on the '84 Dune. I understand this seems to be a divisive comment for many. And I find that sad that people can't just tolerate that others have different tastes.I have consumed any new adaptation of Dune, whether it be TV series or movie. The '21 Dune was something that just didn't click for me. I understand there were some production constraints due to the pandemic which made the editing difficult if not impossible, and in my opinion there were some critical errors made in casting. I say that because although I was excited for Dune Part Two my expectations were certainly measured.Denis Villeneuve (and his production team) are the great cinematographers & art directors of our time. The images Denis puts to screen are magnificent. However just because you frame a beautiful scene does not necessarily mean you have created an engaging screenplay. And I think the area where his Dune adaptations fall short of being perfect 10/10 is in the misfires in casting.The '84 Dune exceeds the adaption in casting in ALMOST every way. Timothee, Zendaya, Momoa, Walken, Bautista, Brolin. These are actors who I enjoy greatly. But they are cast in these movies based upon looking a certain way. They are not great fits for the roles. Yet, Dune Part Two succeeds in spite of this. I honestly don't see how you can try to argue the casting. You want to tell me that Jason Momoa is a better Ducan Idaho than Richard Jordan? Chris Walken. I mean I love the guy. But it's a very odd choice for Emperor. I think the movie succeeds IN SPITE of Timothee and Zendaya not being particularly strong leads. I love DRAX, best comic relief sidekick ever. But lets be honest Bautista's dramatic acting chops are not top tier. There were of course a few upgrades. Rebecca Ferguson & Florence Pugh were excellent. I don't think Javier Bardem was great as Stilgar in Part One, but in Part Two he absolutely carried the movie. His performance blew me away. It gave the movie heart.The screenplay of Dune Part Two was a great improvement over part one. It was exceptionally true to the books. Other than the exclusion of the Guild Navigators (that was disappointing). The screenplay brilliantly captured the messiah elements. The only critique I would make is that the Geidi Prime scenes (which was a surreal detour into German expressionism) consumed too much run time which caused the climax and last act to feel rushed and unearned. There was a decision to feature Feyd (feels like a Hollywood $ decision) much more than in the book, and this takes away from other elements in the movie. Alia (The Knife) Atreides was excellent. The way they presented her character was brilliant. ATJ was Alia. Well, that's genius.Great day I bet you are thinking. Did you even like the movie? YES.The movie was exceptional.It moved me emotionally many times. The scene where Paul rides the grandfather worm moved me to tears. The pacing for a long movie was excellent. The effects were incredible. Sound design incredible. Art direction incredible. Score incredible.Dune Part Two was an improvement upon Dune Part One. And I think its fair to say that's a consensus.I hope this movie makes a lot of money and I intend to see it a few more times in cinema. Despite its shortcomings in casting (which you may or may not agree with) it is a brilliant piece of cinema. And we as fans should support it so that we will be rewarded with another installment.",

Even blade runner 2024 ended with some emotion.I think there's a fundamental issue when your leading man has no depth. No character, good looks but zero Charisma. (Even Ryan goslings replicant made you feel for him). Everyone acting around Chalamet was in a different league. Even mark hamill was believable as Luke skywalker. Timothy was a pretty face with nothing behind his generic line readings.

Such exquisite work, such delicacy and dedication could only result in a film that will leave its mark for a long, long time. As soon as the movie ends, it's hard to decide whether I want to watch it all over again or if I need a sequel. Dune 2 is a beautiful example that hard work and talent always pay off. I find it difficult to write about what I liked because I'm still ecstatic about what I saw. The character development works very well, especially with Paul and his mother's arc. The meticulously crafted art direction and photography, the sound design aimed at deeper immersion, the choreography of the fights is excellent, but what truly captivates us is the perfect work of director Denis Villeneuve who, unsurprisingly, hits the mark once again. A simply incredible film and worth every second.",

It's laser beams, intergalactic warfare and complicated dynastic relationships and scheming will easily fit into your weekend's movie night. Turn the sound on full volume, give it a big screen and enjoy! Only lightsabers are missing but oh well, you get saber fights anyway :)This is well written drama, I enjoyed it and it fulfilled it's purpose. The interesting aspect of this movie and the series theme was how it takes inspiration from islam. The movie relies heavily on religious aspects as basically the whole movie is about the coming of messiah and salvation. At the same time, it doesn't fit at all to the movie and still somehow it makes the whole movie.I saw this in movie theater which gave it extra points. I do not consider this movie worth of second watch. Good action anyways and I did not got bored.",

    "Review Content": "Dune 2 is as good as an adaptation in film form can be. Casting, acting, world building, sound, cinematography, everything is great.Timothée Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson are the stars of the show and both perfectly deliver the transition to manipulative, unsympathetic characters. Compared to the first one where they are victims of betrayal and you feel for their loss, in this one you only feel sympathy for them until you realize the only reason is knowing the Harkonnen are so much worse. Paul is not a hero, something the first movie didn't make clear.The rest of the cast is great. Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin and Stellan Skarsgard are great as usual. Dave Bautista has surprising range and seems to do his best work with Villeneuve on the helm. I'm seeing a lot of praise for Austin Butler and his performance was good, but not anything extraordinary. His character is a psychopath and doesn't leave much room for subtlety. Zendaya is good, but in the beginning it feels like she's replaying her character from Spider Man. She has only two modes, annoyed and concerned. She does much better on the second half. Christopher Walken is great, obviously, but it was distracting to cast such a well-known actor as a character that wasn't even shown before and who is very reserved and secluded by the very nature of his role.The movie is almost 3 hours long and it didn't feel that much, but it had some minor pacing issues. It feels rushed at some points and I think it lacked some transition scenes. For instance, I wanted to see more transitions with spaceships in space, like we see once in the first one. They make the vast distances between planets clearer and increase the sense of isolation and remoteness of Arrakis. The movie doesn't really feel like an interplanetary epic. It feels like everything is happening very close.I wish the role of spice was made clearer in the first one and it wasn't, so I was expecting that in this one and I was disappointed it was overlooked again. Without showing the navigators, their role and the transformations they go through, the spice feels more like a McGuffin than an integral part of the plot. I'm not a fan of the books but I know the navigators are really introduced only in Messiah. However, I think having an earlier hint of their role and the real importance of spice would make the stakes clearer, specially when we see Paul's visions about the future and his decision to go through with it, knowing what will happen.Overall, its few minor flaws are due to things that are missing, and I'm sure Villeneuve had to make many hard decisions about what to leave out of the movie to keep the runtime reasonable.",

Another waste of production money for the purpose of self glorification of the director and producers who deserve to be 🥊 in the face for the stylistic choices made to mutilate the material.Watching this, just like part 1, I simply did not care about any of this. I watched this cuz I thought part 1 was the prelude and part 2 would be more exciting but it just isn't. You can make highly compelling films but no one told these guys how to do that. Style over substance, it doesn't really matter as long as enough ppl are dumb enough to pay for a ticket.PS: Rebecca Ferguson is exempt from this review, she is incredible but her work alone cannot save this train wreck.",

    "Review Content": "Last night I was fortunate enough to view a back-to-back screening of 'Dune: Part One' followed by 'Dune: Part Two' in the theater. It was my third time seeing part one on the big screen, and just as delightful as before. Denis Villeneuve has created some of my all-time favorite movies - 'Prisoners' and 'Sicario', so I knew I was in for a treat once again. Grand scale science-fiction that is done 'right', usually gets me hyped out of the wazoo. I'm happy to say this one had me constantly on the edge of my seat as well.The visuals and lore of the Dune universe that Denis has transformed into film is magnificently breathtaking but most importantly of all; unique. The Harkonnen homeworld 'Giedi Prime' is by far one of my favorite planet designs (black/white light, brutalist architecture, the violent nature of its people) ever. The arena scene and introductory moment for na-Baron Feyd-Rautha got my blood pumping like a thumper.Just like in my previous review for 'Dune: Part One', Rebecca Ferguson is one of my standouts once again. In comparison to last chapter in which she felt rather afraid and unsure, she now completely transformed into a whole different person who, to be quite frank, is terrifying. Her screen presence is absolutely captivating and mesmerizing.In a movie with so many A-tier names, it is difficult to pick a favorite. Though, I think Timothée Chalamet's\n'Paul Muad'dib Atreides' might just be it. I wasn't fully convinced last film, but his monologue in the South and the way he portrayed Paul's transformation into the Messiah he himself fears, was brilliant. The baron, played by Stellan Skarsgård, will forever be - despite his little screentime - one of my favorite villainous characters in science-fiction.Hans Zimmer blew me away with the score for this film, more than the last. I'm a sucker for fast-paced soundtrack, and the more frequent and high-stakes action sequences in this second part allowed for Hans Zimmer to play into that with his music. The track that comes on when the Fremen ride into battle on sandworms against the Emperor's Sardauker army, is exhilarating and extremely powerful. This living legend has mastered his craft for sure.My only reason for this film not being a straight ten-star, is the ending. I cannot judge on the accuracy between the film and the novels, since I haven't read them, but the ending left me feeling slightly hung and yearning for more. I'm not sure if I just experienced a cliffhanger that will be further explored in a third chapter, or a brutal open ending. Either way, the story is great and whether or not Denis will make this a trilogy, these past two films will go down in my list as some of the best sci-fi ever made.",

In the first movie, we can feel that Saudakar soldiers are very feared, unmatched in strength but in this sequel, the fermen make it look easy to kill them. I don't get it. In first movie you make them look strong but in the sequel they look weak. Third, the final battle between the fremen and the emperor seems ordinary and not epic, unlike the war in the first movie when atredis fight harkonen.The sequel is good but it lacks the epicness of the first movie.",

Couldn't they just take down the capital as they did with the emperor's base).The movie is a succession of 15 minutes contemplative and insignificant scenes followed by 3 minutes groundbreaking, taken out of nowhere, scenes.Secondary characters are useless and disposable at will, the viewer cannot even get attached or hate anyone because they no they can disappear in a minute, this a nothing but a one man show.",

    "Review Content": "This movie leaves you speechless as you walk out of the theater given its scale, length, story telling, acting, action, emotions, and the cinematography that unfolds for almost 3hrs. It takes you a while to replay in your head all the parts you liked (theres a lot) and when you finally have time to process everything some hours later, you might find yourself wondering \"Did i just watch the best SciFi movie ever?\".Those are lofty and almost unfair expectations to place on any movie. Yet, the thought crosses your mind that it might be.And the reason for that question? Part 2 pulls on your emotional strings in a way the first doesnt even try to. The relationship between Paul and Chani is complicated - both are in vulnerable places, and its that vulnerability that surprisingly makes this movie ultimately a tragedy. For the folks who see beyond all the awesome effects and the action scenes, you're actually left with a deep sadness in the end for how the two main characters stories unfold.It wasn't until the second time through watching this movie that the emotional elements resonated with me, perhaps because I knew how things ended. And they added a completely new dynamic to the film that will honestly persist for a while. Theres something heartbreaking about two young people falling in love and being apart of an epic tale, yet different worlds collide and competing views prevent that relationship from blossoming.Perhaps the only critique I have of this movie is that in the very last scene, with Chani alone on the dune looking out into the desert, about to find her own path after she's been totally betrayed in the worst way, was to have a single tear drop slide down her face as the camera goes in for a close-up. It would've driven home the pain she was feeling so much more and I think it could've left everyone (even the casual movie goers) with the correct impression about this tale. Its simultaneously an amazing spectacle but also sad.Well done, Denis and team. You've done it again.",

The scenery/sets, the music, the cast, the plot, the fight scenes... all really good stuff. Objectively, this is a GOOD movie.Here are other stuff I liked before people get upset: I really liked Fade and Chani. Both of them were well written and acted. Fade was fantastic, and I loved the changes to Chani's character from the book. I laughed when she left Paul at the end. As she should!! I liked how she had her own views and didn't just blindly follow Paul. Speaking of Paul, wow, the scene where he spoke to all the Fremen was great. Actually, ALL the actors did a great job at portraying their characters.I also want to say that I read the book and loved it. I also watched the original 1984 movie and loved it. So, what went wrong?? Well...Now, here's what I DIDN'T like about this movie. Let's just say that I'm mad for personal reasons. My sister was named after Paul's sister. This new movie not only didn't say her name at all (Alia), but they cut her out of the movie by making her not be born yet. I don't want to sound petty, but she had such an important part in the original that cutting her out completely changed the story!!With all the talk of having Jessica and Chani do more in this adaptation (which I like!!), cutting out Alia killing the Baron and making Paul do it was very backwards thinking. Paul already kills Fade, why make him kill the Baron too?? And he just walked in and stabbed him with everyone watching??? HUH?? Very anti-climatic... at least make Jessica do it if you had to change it! Alia killing the Baron is so iconic!!So yeah, I'm upset that Alia was cut out. At least she WAS still in it... there were other stuff I didn't like too. I thought the first half was very slow paced. And I LIKE slow movies!! But this one felt like they were in the desert for way too long... that's what happens when you stretch a movie into two parts. Also, the end battle was like 15 minutes tops?? With all the build-up, it could have been longer. And then it just... ended?? Without SHOWING it end?? They just said \"the battle's over\". What???Anyway, that's my take. I'm being honest. There were stuff I liked and stuff I didn't, but I'm just personally mad that they cut out my sister's namesake. I'm glad other people liked it though, and I'm glad it was made and adapted for a modern audience, but I recommend reading the book. It still holds up!",

    "Review Content": "This movie is a huge step-up to the first instalment. It is the very movie the cinema industry needs at this current slum in film quality.Take Madame Web, for example. A result of poor production and corrupt admin. The movie is worse than horrible because it's been flushed out of production with no second thought purely so the investors can take their bag and move on.Dune is quite literally the complete opposite of this. The developers have a deep connection to the source material, and their devotion is crystal clear.Dune: Part 2 is a culmination of hard work, dedication, commitment and the proper use of narrative storytelling and structure. There are no points in this movie where one may 'fall asleep' which was where the first movie fell off.The way in which the movie has been structured and presented allows the viewer to completely immerse themselves, making them feel like they are within the world of Dune itself, watching events play out as a warrior along Paul's side or one of his religious fanatics.The movie, in most senses, actually moves TOO fast - which may hurt the interpretation of what's presented (because most moviegoers are far too used to the poor and eye-candy structure of most current action films). But, nonetheless, if you pay proper attention and try your best to understand, you probably will.On a side note, this movie couldn't have achieved what it has without its predecessor. Many have forgotten what happened in the first instalment because of its failure to properly entertain the audience, but after breaking down the first film you can see the dependance the sequel has to the first film.One last point, this movie would not be the achievement that it is without its stunningly beautiful use of soundtrack and CGI.This film goes above and beyond in the way it integrates the music with narrative tension and overall impact. It would not have been as jaw-dropping without Hanz Zimmer's S-tier performance and love of composition - should i even mention how well he immerses himself into the film's universe to produce such fitting and unique sound?Additionally, this film stands as a manual on how to properly use CGI and stage control. It goes against the current methods of using animation to please the eye, and yet, showed us things more stunning and impactful than the poorly rendered scenes presented by studios such as Marvel and Sony that everyone seems to appreciate way too much.Control over production, is control over impact!",

I had some explaining to do after the movie, because the crew left a lot of things unexplained, but somehow chose to keep some scenes that seemed barely necessary to the main plot (like the beginning of the trial of Paul going on his first solo trip to the desert and back). I know the book is long and had to be condensed, but really, I couldn't help but notice continuity gaps and lack of proper explanation for some things while watching. Here are some questions that were unanswered or barely hinted at in this film:why/how is Paul's sister able to communicate with his mother from the womb?why didn't the Harkonnen army finish off the inhabitants of Sietch Tabr when raiding it? Why give them a window to escape just to reload ammo? Why even come with not enough ammo? Couldn't they afford a few extra battleships on site?why would the fremen leave one person behind when moving out of Sietch Tabr? This looked like a totally useless sacrifice.how did the Harkonnen army not notice tens of thousands of fremen gathering and cheering just outside their capital city walls before the final battle?how did part of the fremen combatants manage to hide in the sand seemingly within the city walls?did the fremen run through a nuclear explosion site right after the explosion?why was the emperor so powerless at the end? His army seemed to just stand there and watch their almighty boss being dethroned.",

    "Review Title": "A Transportive Cinematic Experience",
    "Review Date": "2024-03-05",
    "Review Content": "'Dune: Part Two' picks up directly where the first left off, with Paul Atreides and his mother, Lady Jessica, still on the run after the surprise attack on House Atreides by the brutal Harkonnens. Now allied with the Fremen of Arrakis, the two survivors must learn the natives' ways if they are to survive the desert planet's harsh conditions. That will not be their only challenge, though, as the threat of House Harkonnen remains and Paul's destiny approaches...For me, the most interesting aspect of 'Dune' is its mythology and lore, which combines classic sci-fi elements with a surprising amount of religious undertones. 'Part Two' dives deeper into the prophecies that foretell the coming of the Kwisatz Haderach, a messianic figure who is destined to free the Fremen from the oppression of offworlders and lead humanity to a better future. Some believe Paul to be this savior, while others insist the prophecies are nothing more than stories meant to further enslave the Fremen by instilling false hope. This creates a compelling clash of ideologies, represented by Stilgar's faith in his beliefs versus Chani's devotion to her people, with both sides having valid arguments. Even Paul himself sometimes struggles with the massive expectations thrust upon him by the believers. However, he's not above using them to his advantage by means of manipulation, giving him a layer of complexity not seen in most typical \"heroes\".The characters, and the actors who portray them, are another of the film's highlights. Timothée Chalamet brings a new intensity to the role of Paul Atreides not seen in 'Part One', further cementing him as one of the finest young performers of our generation. Rebecca Ferguson (Lady Jessica) does the same, along with something else I certainly wasn't expecting: straight-up freakiness. Nearly everyone in the cast is great, save for Christopher Walken who feels... out of place as the Emperor. The film's MVP, though, is easily Austin Butler's Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, who delivers an absolutely spine-chilling performance akin to Heath Ledger's Joker and Javier Bardem's Anton Chigurh.Some may claim 'Dune: Part Two's greatest strengths lie in its technical elements, which serve to elevate the film even higher. Its cinematography, production design, sound, and visual effects work in tandem to stimulate the senses and create one of the most transportive cinematic experiences I've had. From the first scene on the sands of Arrakis my eyes were wide open and glued to the screen. Unfortunately, I found the climax of the film to be underwhelming. It begins in epic fashion yet ends quite abruptly shortly after, which is especially disappointing given how well the filmmakers lay the groundwork for the conflict over the course of both movies. It's still an enjoyable sequence but ultimately felt anticlimactic after all the buildup.Although 'Dune: Part Two' may not fully live up to the hype, in my book, I absolutely do not regret spending my time and money on it. The film takes everything I enjoyed about its predecessor and builds upon it in (mostly) satisfying ways while introducing intriguing new layers to the characters and mythology. Just do yourself a favor and see it on the biggest screen possible, because this is the kind of movie made for the theatrical experience. I can now safely say that the 'Dune' franchise has me hooked, and with the promise of a third installment on the way, I eagerly await my next adventure to Arrakis.",

    "Review Content": "A *very* well made movie that ticks all the scifi genre boxes but is it really that good?Dune 2 picks up where most of us were left wondering \"what on earth is going on?\" in Dune 1.You can't help but fall in love with the cinematography and the \"world building\", despite most of it being set the desert. The incredible performance by the cast and multiple action sequences make this movie far more interesting than the previous installment. Yet, despite these great aspects, the plot just seems to be even more confusing than Dune 1.I understand the visionary idea behind the \"slow\" (?) character/plot building but it would be nice to actually know what is going every now and then...The character building appears to be slow and quite vague. Many new/old faces appear in the movie with no real explanation regarding who they are and it's left up to the audience to comprehend what's going on. By the time you've figured out who's who you've missed three different action sequences and ten important plot points...The pacing of the movie was far better than the first one. For starters: things actually happen in this one! But the action sequences, despite being *very* good, fall slightly short as they are constantly interrupted by intense staring, slow motion desert walking shots or some random scene happening somewhere else.I felt the plot was OK/GOOD. Nothing particularly special... a bit too \"religious\" at times; it felt like watching a movie about Jesus. But overall it was solid and the main storyline is quite comprehensible.Overall it's a decent sequel. With that said it has it's issues: it's just as confusing as the first movie, there are some plot holes (the worms that pose a massive threat in the first movie are now not so dangerous?), still don't really understand why the soldiers use swords when they appear to have firearms and many characters lack any type of backstory...Enjoyed it but wouldn't watch it again. *Very* overhyped, especially on social media!",

It detached itself from the characters, dedicating itself to the story. A story certainly distant from the original film, but a solid and directed compass. The greatest praise to recognize passes through the almost six hours traveled where the feeling of anticipation for what lies ahead prevails. Dune finally emancipated itself from the dreamlike journey of Paul Muadhib Atreides (Harkonnen), generating a whole universe that will continue to attract the attention of fans of good cinema.",

Word ..... at a time. Pan out. BWAAAAP/loud noise, next scene, rinse and repeat, stir in the occasional action scene.There are a lot of dialog scenes in this movie, but not much is said. I understand that the book is both thick and dense, so showing everything in slow motion seems an odd choice. I honestly think, if you watch this at home, you could watch it at 2x speed and it might be a decent way to spend an hour and 15 minutes.The battle scenes were also kinda dumb. This is ~8000 years in the future, inter-galactic space flight exists, planes, helicopters, nuclear warheads, guns, lazers, bazookas and more all exist, yet people decide to go to battle as if it's the middle ages - fighting with knives! You don't need to be a messiah to realize that you could bring guns to a knife fight. I'll give them poetic liscense on this one and perhaps we can write it off to the aesthetics, but it did make some of the scenes a little laughable once you realize what's going on. Maybe they explain this in the book?I did not enjoy Dune 1 for much the same reasons, but so many people were saying this one was better. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me!

It is the quint essential \"show don't tell\" model on full display. It has such a natural flow and the editing is perfectly done as we are not jolted back and forth between story lines.The real question is how the general audience will respond to this film as it does not overly explain anything and can at times be confusing as to what is happening if one is not paying close attention.It is one film I really anticipate returning to theaters to experience for at least one more time, maybe 2!",

I loved it.But like the first movie, this one is held back from true greatness by Hollywood's commercial obsession with shortening run-times.Later half of the movie strips away massive chunks of the original story, oversimplifying or even completely omitting characters, events and conflicts. It felt rushed, abrupt, unresolved, unexplained and lacking in payoff.So I really hope Mr Villeneuve has stashed away all of these stripped-out components of both movies, for an 8-9 hours long complete Director's Cut.

I didn't like Part 1 as much because I thought it didn't do much for us to invest in these characters - what had worked was the world building, cinematography, myth building, and art. But it still paled in comparison to Lawrence of Arabia, the story of which Herbert basically retells in the sci-fi format of Dune. With this movie, the story is finally complete, with hopes of a Dune Messiah to actually fulfill Paul Atreides' prophetic arc.Good things about this movie: (1) Everything is of epic proportions and scale, just like its predecessor. (2) Epic scenes like Paul's worm riding. (3) Art, costume and set design. (4) The constant reminder of the self-fulfilling nature of the prophecy. (5) Zendaya's acting and using Chani as the relatable character. (6) Hans Zimmer's music was a constant throwback to some of his classics like Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons. And finally, (7) although Denis being called humorless, there are quite a few funny moments in this movie!Bad things: (1) the story being so dense and long, Denis and his editing team has had to cut some expectedly epic scenes into shorter fleeting less-than-memorable moments - all Harkonnen deaths, barring the last one, are good examples of such. (2) Rushed pacing in the final third hour of the movie, that left a rather jarring effect of the storytelling on me. (3) Extremely unbelievable dialog delivery by Chalamet and rushed ascendency of Paul in assuming his messianic destiny among the southern Fremen. Also some sketchy exposition after Paul drinks the Water of Life. Sigh.An epic movie, in all possible ways. Not perfect, but better than most big budget movies.. except maybe Oppenheimer.",

Their overall tone of dialogue matched the motivations they had. Like how Lady Jessica is being more manipulative than ever. Rebecca Ferguson was a phenomenal actress. Zendaya also shined. Her character's desperation for saving Paul was heartbreaking, and she nailed the right emotions for Chani. And Timothée Chalamet is a very versatile actor. I love every movie he is into. The scene where he spoke to the Fremen underground as the Lisan al Gaib gave me chills, even though the movie felt hot.Second are the visual effects. As a cinephile who always looks for the visuals of a film, this movie outshined itself. It captured the whole environment depicted in the novel series. It was a breathtaking experience because it is quite rare to watch movies that were taken in a deserted place taking place in a different world. The appearance of the sandworm, or shai-hulud, made an impact. Its colossal magnitude shook the whole theater like I was there riding it. The scenes in Giedi Prime were cool, including the battle scene with Feyd. With its brutalist architecture and the monochrome color grading, it's so atmospheric.With the ability of Hans Zimmer to describe emotions through music, the score resonates with the mystique of the Dune universe. It triggers awe for something so unworldly, but mixed with a warning of imminent danger, it totally fits the movie's narrative.The writing also still landed. The great pacing connected it to the previous film and made a path for the movie's direction. I sat for 2 hours straight and never felt any boredom at all; it made me more excited. The build-up to the climax was crazy. Fleshing out new characters and adding them for more political turmoil and hindrances up to the final battle between Paul and Feyd, it was intense and menacing.The mixture of real-world cultures of Middle Eastern countries blends well with the theme of the movie, which was all about foreign colonizers using fear and faith as their tool to control. The theme made me question my reality. \"How are we going to believe?\" Are we just going to wait until a prophecy is fulfilled, or are we going to make it a reality? The movie warned me about the danger that a false belief could pose.Thank you, Denis Villeneuve, for carrying the new generation of sci-fi genre films and the whole of Hollywood itself. All the movies you have made have had an impact on me, which inspires me to be a filmmaker someday.",

The second dune is little more action packed than the first and the whole atmosphere In the movie is little bit different, both are great thou. Cast as I sain is excellent, Timothee Chalamet is convincing as a Paul Atreides but also Stellan Skarsgård, Florence Pugh and Zendaya are good. But biggest points go to the magnificent Austin Butler, Oscar worthy acting. The director mr Villeneuve is very precise and let his actors to shine. And the music in the movie is very haunting, in a good way. Overall, great movie, almost three hours long,but didn't feel like it.",

The way his character develops throughout this movie is GORGEOUS, he needs an Oscar and Medal for this, JESUS.Austin Butler was FASCINATING to watch, his voice, his expressions, his cruelty in this movie is mind-boggling.Zendaya slayed as usual, she's perfect and the way she showed channi's emotions was BREATHTAKING.I want this whole movie tattooed into my brain forever and ever.",

From it's stunning visuals to its beautiful audio the movie exceeds it all. The fight choreography is nothing short of perfect, the dialogue feels like actual dialogue and the performances are all fun. It is genuinely one of the best movies I have ever seen.

    "Review Content": "I quickly became a fan of Dune after a buddy of mine told me to give the Dune (1984) movie a watch. My first - uneducated - response to him was \"It reminds me of a Star Wars ripoff.\" He quickly got me up to speed on the history of Dune and I read the first book. I became hooked.When Dune: Part One first came out I had to watch it on IMAX first. I've since watched it over a dozen times. An epic movie that I feel did a great job of sticking to the book while also moving around some elements for cinematic effect and to not overload the audiences with all of the characters of Dune.Dune: Part Two also did a great job of sticking to the book and really hyped up the battle scenes. The characters, for the most part, also gained a lot more depth and building in this second movie.A part of me wishes I knew nothing of the books to watch the films as they unfold. Since I already know what happens I'm not as surprised where things end up. It'd be like going into Star Wars already knowing Vader is Luke's father. Still a fantastic movie, but you lose some of the \"woah!\" factor.Regardless, I really enjoyed the movie and I've already preordered it. And I plan on watching it a dozen times as well.",

It was as if we were all transported to Arrakis together, and we had no choice but to experience every moment of it.And it was glorious. To say this film is magnificent is an understatement. To say it's phenomenal does not fully explain its effect.Every shot is tuned precisely to what we need to see. Every sound and musical cue is perfectly matched with its visual component. The acting is flawless across the board. The cinematography is absolutely brilliant.Almost three hours of movie, and I wanted more. We all wanted more.In my opinion, there are only three genre-defining fantasy stories: Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings, and Dune. After seeing Dune: Part One and this magnificent sequel, if I had to pick just one universe, I would choose the universe of Arrakis, of Caladan, of Paul and Chani, of Feyd and Baron, of Princess Irulan, every time.Long Live the Fighters.",

However, it captures your senses so dramatically that you have little time to even pin point its miscues. The pacing, direction, sound, cinematography and acting are all exceptional. Timothee Chalamet gives arguably his best performance to date and really showcases his talents. There is never a scene that is wasted or over shot. The sound design will leave you speechless and the visuals are awe aspiring. Dune 2 already has its place on the Mount Rushmore of best sequels in cinematic history.

Plus the political and religious undertones advance the storyline so much more than anything Star Wars could have envisioned..guess it's only fair since Dune influenced Star Wars. And if you are a fan of Game of Thrones this will be right up your alley!But overall this is a special masterful moment in movie making and Sci-fi. Bring on Dune Messiah!",

    "Review Content": "Denis Villeneuve has always stood out with his films thanks to the visual component. His pictures had a remarkable sensitivity to moving images. Of course, this aspect of Villeneuve's work evolved with each of his subsequent films. If we compare the first part of \"Dune\" with the second, we can see that there is even a significant leap in visual storytelling. I think this is related to the fact that the first \"Dune\", both for Denis and for the audience, was a film that merely introduced us to this world. \"Dune 2\", on the other hand, is already something more familiar for Denis and for us. However, this film never ceases to amaze. Every scene is endowed with remarkable visual narration in one form or another. There is always some aspect, detail, that adds to the world of \"Dune\" and allows it to be revealed from different angles. This film, for me, is what cinema is capable of in terms of visuals - it manifests imagination into reality, allowing us to see imagination without imagining, thanks the wonderful team that worked on this film and Denis Villeneuve himself.Having been familiar with the book \"Dune\", I want to say that in my opinion, Denis and the screenwriters successfully conveyed the idea of \"Dune\". I may not be the first to say this, but the book itself is somewhat dry, considering its writing style. However, the idea of faith that Herbert embedded in the book makes this story not only about the planet Arrakis and Paul Atreides but also about the human spirit. Indeed, the film very clearly conveys this idea, making it a spiritual experience.I believe Denis Villeneuve will make the final, third film something unforgettable.",

    "Review Content": "Dune - Part 2\" takes audiences on a spellbinding odyssey across the majestic sands of Arrakis, weaving a tapestry of breathtaking visuals and intricate storytelling reminiscent of the complexity found in Indian politics. As the sequel to the highly acclaimed \"Dune,\" this installment promises an even deeper immersion into the rich universe created by Frank Herbert, where alliances are fragile, and power is the ultimate currency.From the opening scenes, viewers are thrust into a world where every grain of sand holds a secret, and every character harbors ambitions that could reshape the fate of entire civilizations. Director Denis Villeneuve masterfully balances the grandeur of the landscape with the intimate struggles of its inhabitants, creating a cinematic experience that is as mesmerizing as it is thought-provoking.At the heart of \"Dune - Part 2\" lies a plot as intricate as the labyrinthine corridors of political power in India. Like a masterful chess game played on a cosmic scale, the narrative unfolds with a series of unexpected twists and turns, keeping audiences on the edge of their seats until the very end. Much like a Bollywood masala film, the story is rich with drama, intrigue, and larger-than-life characters whose destinies are intertwined in ways both profound and unforeseen.Yet, amidst the political machinations and intergalactic power struggles, \"Dune - Part 2\" introduces an unlikely hero: the sandworms of Arrakis. Previously viewed as mere beasts of burden, these colossal creatures emerge as symbols of resilience and defiance, challenging the established order and reshaping the very fabric of Indian cinema. Their presence adds a layer of myth and mystique to an already captivating narrative, serving as a reminder that true heroism often comes from the unlikeliest of places.What sets \"Dune - Part 2\" apart from other sci-fi epics is its ability to transcend the boundaries of genre and resonate with audiences on a deeply human level. Amidst the spectacle of interstellar warfare and cosmic intrigue, the film explores themes of identity, destiny, and the enduring struggle for freedom. It is a testament to the power of storytelling to illuminate the human condition and inspire audiences to ponder the deeper questions of existence.As the credits roll and the echoes of the final battle fade into the ether, one cannot help but feel a sense of longing for more. Like a plate of piping hot samosas on a rainy day, \"Dune - Part 2\" leaves audiences craving for another taste of its intoxicating blend of action, suspense, and spectacle. It is a testament to the enduring appeal of cinema to transport us to worlds beyond our imagination and leave us forever changed by the experience.",

With amazing storytelling and music that immerses you in this sci-fi, fantazy world. The most beautiful scenery and images in every scene. And acting that just can't be complained about. But the story suffers from poor character writing in some parts.SOUNDS AND SOUNDTRACK: I saw the movie in the cinema with Dolby Surroundsound and it was one of the greatest experiences with sound i have had. Hans Zimmer made a track that is unique and fitting the genre of sci-fi, and the setting. I will definitely check out the soundtrack later.STORY AND STORYTELLING: The story fit in extremely well with its precursor and very few if any bad kliches. It was thought out, thought provoking, and emotionally provoking. There was very little i thought could have been done differently: Paul's sudden change of heart regarding being leader, felt dissatisfying as he had no inner conflict with his choices or embarassment towards Chani. The death of Rabban i thought was too fast, being done in only 3 or 4 moves, with little to no emotional satisfaction. The twist of the baron being his grandfather felt a little unasked for. But if it plays a bigger role in the third installment, it won't be a problem. And lastly the death of Feyd Rautha. I enjoyed Austin Butlers character enormesly and didnt like seeing him die. But also think that his death was very well writin and epic. I no longer see Austin Butler for his role as Elvis.THE PACING: It felt very thought through and worked well on the big screen. It really gave way for us to enjoy the stunning images, without feeling forced. Though i wanted more of Paul and Chani's chemistry, and a scene with Paul telling her about his visions of her. I think that would have shown their tight bond, and make the ending even more heart crushing.FINAL RATING: 9,3\n-Alvin Bladt 16yo.",

I simply cannot compare it any other SCI-FI movie, it just feels like there's no comparison at all. I reckon that this movie will break the box office record of all time and has every right to do so. I believe I will have to watch it on more time on IMAX because once it's just no enough. Visuals and artwork are just out of this world and it feels surreal eve watching it. I hope there will be a part 3 because the story cannot end there and it would be a shame to end there.",

It seemed to me that Hollywood was only able to produce movies based on standard scheme to provide audience with average movies that can make enough money for the studios. Dune 2 finally gave me what I was hoping for. I wasn't able to take my eyes off the screen. Movie, storyline, actors and SOUND were all astonishing and breathtaking. I felt like I was part of the movie. I regret only that Christopher Walken wasn't given more time and space in the movie and that battles were epic, nevertheless short and solved and won within few moments. Even with these \"scars on face\" I must say I enjoyed this movie very much and plan to see it again. Btw. Stilgar played by Bardem was very enjoyable character.",

I really had to think about what it all meant and how I felt about it and that is also a minus. I felt like a lot was not really explained and like I had fallen asleep been scenes and missed something. I also felt really uncomfortable with the whole idea of fundamentalism and a holy war, but I guess that was intended. But all in all I was really fascinated by it and ripped me in a way no sci-fi movie has done in a long time. Star Wars could really something here. It makes you want to learn and understand more.

    "Review Content": "Timotheé Chalamet had an impressive role in Call Me by Your Name, but it was not until The King the following year that I truly saw the layers of his acting. After watching The King, I compared him to a young Al Pacino - and then he basically flew off my radar since.I didn't like any of his subsequent roles, including as Paul Atreides in Dune, which is a film I found to be artfully made but, like most other Denis Villeneuve films, lacking something that touches me.I wasn't going to see Dune 2, except that I did. It was as everyone else said - epic, sweeping, complex, and well-made in all aspects. Having said that, it is Timothée who truly defines this film as a much more complex Paul Atreides, representing both the best and worst of messiah fervor. He reminds me of Henry V in The King, except with more charisma, maturity and a darkness that hides deeper. Everyone else in the film, with perhaps the exception of Zendaya, impresses and matches Timothée's lead.Now, having read through enough information, I understand that if Messiah is made, that the storyline may entail Paul's downfall. Dune and Dune 2 may not be as significant to the world of cinema as The Godfather Part 1 and Part 2, but Dune: Messiah has the setup to surpass the final chapter of The Godfather.This time, we may truly witness the epic transformation of a man from hero to god to destroyer, reminiscent of a Greek tragedy, offering a potentially unparalleled exploration of power and its consequences.",

Lots of problems, the characters jump from location to location and there is a lot of filling in the gaps, it is by no means a fluid film. The dialogue is fairly mediocre at times, the score is good but not masterful. A rather annoying proliferation of American accents pervade the film as well and really take one out of the universe, particularly from Zendaya. Overall a good film and an achievement for all those involved but this story (the hero's journey) has been told much better than what we see here with Dune.It is not all negative though, some very nice cinematography. Good performances from the lead and Havier Bardem providing some much needed comic relief as well.",

Some reviews here are saying the movie was true to the book, which I don't understand because they also don't even touch on the Space Guild.Vapid acting: Paul. Bautista can only scream? Everyone seemed demoralized in their roles (I would be too if I was Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, or anyone else who actually wanted to embrace the role of a lifetime and was so absolutely diminished).\"Cinematography\": I must be hard to get more than a handful of creative shots of sand. What was happening on the Harkonnen home world? Honestly the blown out black and white scene felt really lazy and cheap. At least after that there was more desert.Christopher Walken: Was his casting supposed to be some sort of meta joke? Even his performance rang flat. I thought the emperor was supposed to be eternally young due to spice consumption. How this character is supposed to be the center / leader of the universe is anyone's guess.I'll wait until it's streaming and finish at my convenience to see if any of this gets salvaged, I just can't imagine how it could be.",

    "Review Content": "I enjoyed this movie. I thought it was very entertaining. Many of the things done in this movie continue the developing story of Paul very well. As the director said at one point, he wanted to show a different side of Paul, that is often lost on the audience, especially whenever Frank released the first book for the first time.Paul is supposed to be a bad guy sorta, he is supposed to be taking revenge on his uncle for his father's death. He wants power, he wants control, and he wants to use that power and control to lead humanity down a certain path. As you get through the story towards the final books released by Franks son, in my opinion, the story comes full circle. Eventually Chani and Paul are just normal people living on Dune as clones of their former selves. Free from all the fighting. As is all of humanity. But that is neither here nor there. This story being told today is never going to be able to tell the whole story of how they got there, 5000+ years into the future. Because of that, it makes no sense to me that they chose to make this movie and tell this story this way.I have no idea where he wants to take this movie series. I imagine Chani will eventually turn on Paul and it would surprise me if she doesn't considering how aggressive he made her towards Paul. So many things are so different from the book/books. Which is fine, because he is telling his own story. However I didn't come here to watch his telling of this story, I came here to watch Dune. I want the story of Dune.My biggest complaint here is that they did not tell the story of Dune, the spice, and why it is so important. I know it is hard to do that, which is why they are choosing to tell the story the way they are. But their is a version of Dune that tells that story. I recommend that people find a way to watch it.Watch Spicediver's Fan Edit of the original dune. In July of 2022, but originally many years ago, a fan that goes by Spicediver, released a Alternate edition. It goes by Dune 1984 The alternative edition redux, a special 1080p edition. This is about 178 mins long and cuts the movie into bits that are more digestible. Explains the story much more completely. It really is the best way to experience Dune, you will not come out confused and despite it not completely following the book. It surely does tell a more complete story that you will walk away from enjoying. It has a slower pace, but also has a more complete story.I liked this movie, I liked the first one. But I have to recommend the alternate edition. It does a much better job than anybody else at editing and putting together a coherent story that really draws you into a sci-fi world ruled by power hungry madmen hopped up on a future drug that enhances the power of humans to near god like levels.",

    "Review Date": "2024-03-04",
    "Review Content": "Dune Part Two is, unfortunately, nothing more than an above-average contemporary Hollywood movie. Above-average because, just like the first part, it looks great and is a fantastic visual experience. It is a Hollywood movie because the plot is very, very thin, verging too many times on the ridiculous. I say this as a huge fan of the novels: Villeneuve & Co. Have made a pretty big mess of this -- just to be clear, it is not a problem that it diverges from Herbert, but that everything is just very crude. Contrary to the first part (which was superior in all respects, including visuals), part two takes significant liberties in changing Herbert's story, mostly by making characters and storylines super one-sided and stereotypical. Dune fans will find it appalling that Stilgar is turned into this stupid, child-like, religious \"fundamentalist\". Chani''s character likewise makes zero sense -- Villeneuvian feminism is generally very good (Sicario is brilliant from this point of view), but it is very crudely executed here. Jessica suddenly becomes a die-hard \"propagandist\". The Baron looks and behaves like a helpless pawn and so on, and so on. Very strangely, most of this is impossible to predict by looking at the first movie, which sticks close to the book (Stilgar, Jessica, the Baron are almost entirely different characters here). By far the worst thing is the turning of (most of the fremen) into religious \"fundamentalists\" (they are repeatedly referred to in this way), which the main characters speak of exactly like this: a kind-of-stupid mass of people that can be manipulated very easily (in the final attack, Paul tells the other main characters that he will just go around and attack \"with the fundamentalists\" -- crazy for anyone who has read Dune). This is very, very, very bad and completely opposed to Herbert's writing. Of course, it is probably easily understood and accepted by what marketing departments believe are the film's main audiences (similar to Nolan's third Batman installment, it absolutely needlessly pays huge tribute to some of the worst of today's political stereotypes). The major weaknesses of the first film are there: sloppy acting (yes, the hugely over-the-top acting from this stellar cast is still there -- why we need the likes of Anya Taylor Joy in a 10-second cameo is also probably explained primarily by marketing departments and not by directorial choice) and editing choices (the part where Paul drinks the water of life and the final battle are perfect examples). Last but not least, the ending is a catastrophe: leaving aside that they needlessly change crucial details apparently to secure plot continuity for a potential sequel, the movie ends with an extremely badly executed cliffhanger that seems to say \"Make sure you tune in next week to watch the third episode\". Overall, this seems way too money-driven and is exactly what Villeneuve promised not to do (oh, I forgot to mention the stupid jokes -- poor Stilgar -- that remind one of Jar Jar Binks). Such a shame, especially since Villeneuve showed with Blade Runner 2049 what he is capable of. Even maintaining the level of Part One would have been much better than this.",

    "Review Content": "Dune 2 captures the essence of the universal dilemmas addressed by Frank Herbert, such as power, responsibility, revenge, and choices, drawing parallels with timeless human experiences. The film, centered on the concept of 'power', develops a cyclical script that anticipates Paul's deep connection with Arrakis, fluctuating between messianism and authoritarianism.Denis Villeneuve, who recently expressed in an interview his disdain for dialogue in films, delivers a powerful script that provokes reflections on messianism and establishes parallels with the current context and political figures. The first half of the movie delves into the dilemma of power and responsibility, presenting Paul as a heroic figure, deeply aware of the historical oppression suffered by the Fremen.In the second half, the transition of Paul Atreides from a Messiah to a conqueror emerges as one of the most intriguing and complex aspects of the plot. This journey, filled with nuances, reflects the tension between destiny and choice, as well as the ethical and moral implications of his decisions. As Paul takes on his role and exercises his power, his trajectory becomes darker, transforming his messianic leadership into a stance of a military conqueror. Thus, the Fremen, previously exploited by outsiders for their planet and resources, now see their faith being manipulated. In this context, faith reveals itself as the true source of power manipulated by Paul, who reassumes his role not as a Fremen, but as a Duke, reinforcing the cyclical structure of the narrative.Paul's rise to power unveils a harsh truth: power corrupts, and the line between the pursuit of justice and authoritarianism becomes blurred. Paul Atreides, oscillating between veneration and fear, becomes a fascinating character study on leadership and sacrifice.",

She does incredibly well with a dumb scriptThe Worms (as creatures) have such integral value to the story and their relationship to Spice is completely absent. They are literally like organic trains for the Fremen.

    "Review Content": "Overall an incredible movie - Herbert would be proud. I feel as if I have been to Arrakis (more sweating would have been more natural lol) and Geidi Prime (Frank would have rewritten some of this world to match the movie!). Only three minor-ish complaints (which keeps it from being a 10/10). 1. The acceptance of Paul seemed hurried (needed another short scene or two - I realize adds a couple minutes to a long movie), 2. Some dialogue was a bit generic and too brief - could have just stated a little more eloquently from time to time, and 3. I really wanted to see the Spacing Guild and folding of space (\"spice\" is the backbone of everything and leaving it out feels odd... probably saving for next movie and budgetary reasons got cut from script). I do recommend reading the first book, Dune... but not horrible to do it after watching both movies (I rarely say this). Anyway, a big two thumbs up!",

    "Review Content": "I am sorry to admit it, but I was a bit disappointed by Dune Part 2. Don't get me wrong, I truly think that it is a far better movie than anything of the genre that was released since Dune Part one, but this movie has flaws that prevented me from fully enjoying it. I am a huge fan of off Denis Villeneuve. We have the same age and we even come from the same town in Québec, Canada. I watched everything that he as done many times and I think that his work is up there with the movies from the best of the industry. Dune 2 is beautiful in every way, most of the actors are great, and the dialogues are very good. However, some stuff did not do it for me. First, the love story between Paul and Shani happens to quickly and we seem to miss many parts of it as there are cuts in the storyline jumping from a moment to a later one. They are lovers and palls but not on the same page which could have been better exploited. The second thing is Jessica going from a loving mother and decent reasonable person to a freaking witch in a, instant. Again, things went to far too quickly. Thirdly, the battle scene was too short, way too short. The Sardaukars are supposed to be the best, but they did not even fight really. We saw very little of the battles. It could have been 5 to 7 minutes longer with a lot more happening. Major disappointment for me. Another thing that did not work for me was that there was almost nothing of the backstory of Gurny behing a smuggler. How can smugglers even exists knowing how controlling the Arkenens are? I did not get that at all. Gurney's character even went a bit wild. I thought that he was a strong but thoughtful and smart man. The emperor seemed like an old and weak man, one that could have been easily controlled by the Bene Gesserit. That did work for me either. And how about the end of the Baron that could not fight, could no do anything to defend itself. A missed opportunities of having a solid argument between Paul and him. Knowing that Alia is the one that killed the Baron in the booking, she could at least have been involved in a way or another through her mother. I truly believe that Part two should have been two separate movies. There was too much story to tell for one single movie. To much thing happening and to much character evolving too rapidly. In a first movie, the fight between the Arkonens and the Fremen could have had a larger escalation. A second movie would be all about the rise of Paul and a longer and more detailed battle. The north and south thing for me was useless and could have been skipped by Denis. By making two movies, we could have more action sequences and a far better understanding of the motivations for each character. Paul's transformation from a smart and sensible young man to a messiah figure could have made more sense if it happened slower, with more self-resistance. Paul became a tyrant in an instant. My final negative reaction is for the studio. The trailer revealed to much and it showed most of the best visual of the entire movie. Dune part two is a blessing and the fact that this Saga was greenlighted knowing how impossible in this to make a movie of these books that are both cleaver and weird at the same time is almost unbelievable knowing how bad the industry is right now. I am glad that the movie did well in the box office for its opening weekend. Go see it for yourself.",

When Dune part three comes out (The director said it is in his vision, however Warner Bros have not approved it yet), I bet this will almost feel like a filler movie. But one that you could watch and not be bored with. I wasn't bored for one second watching this movie. The acting is great, costume, make up, CGI, scripting everything was amazing. I would not be surprised if this franchise went down as one of the greatest sci-fi franchises (obviously below alien). It was done incredibly well, and it's worth a watch.",

Although I haven't read the books since the second half of the film, and especially towards the end, clichés appear, the story is obviously deprived of essential details of the book.

It's nice that it came out and it's generally an excellent film, but because of the name it bears and the way it was realized, I'm giving it this rating.",

    "Review Content": "I'm so impressed.I read the books, so I know how difficult it is to even write a script that could do justice to the saga.I actually would not want to see the whole thing in movies, maybe books 1, 2 and 3 (Dune, Dune Messiah, and Children of Dune) covering Paul and his twin children, but I think futher with the time laps of several thousand years, and the whole transmutation in worm and so on, it gets much more complex, more difficult to create a powerful script.Villeneuve's Dune part 1 was amazing, but this part 2 takes it to another level.The movie's esthetics is pure art and reminds me of other iconic visual creations in movies like Frits Lang's Metropolis, Kubrick's 2001 Space Odyssey, Lean's Lawrence Of Arabia, the Mad Max universe in general, and of course the Star Wars movies - after all those are taking their inspiration from Dune, the book, so it's kind of a return to the source. Hard not to see as well Tarantino's influence in the treatment of violence.There is some urban film noir esthetic going on, some religious crowds on messianic worship vibes, and even classic Greek theater - the tragedies, of course, after all Herbert's main characters are the Atreides - with the Bene Gesserit women as coryphée, but also graphic novels and bande dessinée (Canada and France have produced marvellous work in that area, no wonder Villeneuve takes that route), including, surprisingly, a nod to Saint-Exupery's Le Petit Prince, as I cannot unsee the visual similarities between Paul/Chalamet and le Petit Prince on top of those dunes, under the sun, his unruly hair and scarf dancing in the wind.I love it. Don't miss it if you like beautiful cinematographic art.",

Heck you can even believe that Paul is a godly figure and not \"oh yeah he did it cos he's the 'chosen one'\" when the time came.Sure they changed more stuff than they did with part one but as a book fan, the changes are very well suited for on screen audience (and make more sense even).

It is nearly 3 hours long but never feels like it drags as every scene is either interesting, exciting, well acted or beautifully shot. There is no filler in this movie, every shot feels like it has purpose or artistic quality. Every actor knocks it out of the park too. There are no bad performances at all and there are no modern hollywood tropes that take you out of the world that has been built by Villeneuve and the production team. It is a serious and sombre film, a sci fi adaptation made with adults in mind - less so an action film and more a meditation on power, religion, vengeance and politics.",

    "Review Content": "Movie was good, a little less well-paced compared to Part One but never boring. The performances improved since the last one, especially Timothee Chalamet as Paul, he really grows into the role here. Zendaya also gets to actually act and have a character as Chani, as opposed to the few minutes of screentime she got in the last one (and most of the time she might as well have been in a perfume commercial, no dialogue just walking through the desert in slow motion lol). Florence Pugh is excellent as Princess Irulan, though I thought some of her costumes looked a little too similar to Jessica's in the first film. Perhaps that was intentional. Rebecca Ferguson as Jessica remains the weakest of the cast but I liked her better here. I was afraid Christopher Walken would phone in his performance as the Emperor, but he does well and brings a commanding presence. I wasn't completely sold on Austin Butler as the psychotic Feyd Rautha; it doesn't help that he still has some of his Elvis voice. Other standout performances include Javier Bardem as Stilgar providing some comic relief, Lea Seydoux, who makes the most of her few minutes of screentime, and a surprise cameo of Anya Taylor-Joy as Alia in a vision of the future. They made a few changes from the book, some of which made sense (months pass instead of years, Paul and Chani do not have an infant son who is killed during the Harkonnen attack, Alia is not born yet) and others which left me scratching my head (Jessica is the daughter of Baron Harkonnen, making Paul his grandson? Why? How does that affect the plot in any meaningful way?). Overall it was a good watch but a lot to take in at once.",

    "Review Date": "2024-03-02",
    "Review Content": "I liked, but did not love the first movie. I, however, loved the first half of this film. It built on the momentum from the first entry and provided a story which was headlined by the compelling tension between Paul and his mother as to whether or not he truly was the prophet that he was believed to be. Watching Paul slowly become a Fremen also provided some light-hearted interactions which effectively served to break up any sense of monotony. Unfortunately, however, the movie ruined its own intrigue and the second half act fell quite flat for me.Put simply, once the movie confirms that Paul really is the prophet, the internal conflict that was plaguing him throughout the first half of the film, as well as the tension between he and his mother seems to quickly vanish. Moreover, from that point on, the film makes it quite clear that nothing and no one can lay a finger on Paul which meant that every obstacle that he faced from that point on seemed quite trivial and left me wanting to fast forward to part 3. I got to the point, sadly, where I simply didn't care what was going to happen next because I knew that, whatever it was, it wouldn't pose a challenge to the protagonist. The film presents obstacles as mountains, and Paul proceeds to jump over them like mole hills. The best example of this is the introduction of Austin Butler's character (Feyd-Rautha). The film makes us spend a significant amount of time being introduced to, learning about, and building up Feyd-Rautha as a potential foe for Paul all for him to be killed, unceremoniously, just seconds after besting Paul in combat. I'm really not sure how Villeneuve thought that Paul, off-camera, somehow flipping around Feyd-Rautha's knife while he was in the middle of executing him would be a satisfying ending to the character that he spent so much time building up, especially considering the way Austin Butler turned in an incredible performance and stole absolutely every scene he was in.I'm hoping that part 3 re-establishes a sense of jeopardy by making Paul face obstacles which actually provide a challenge because, on the whole, I'm still interested to see how this story comes to an end. I'm just crossing my fingers that I don't have to, once again, spend a significant portion of the film feeling like all the obstacles in Paul's path are nothing more than minor inconveniences.Overall, I'd say that the first half is a 4/5 but the second half is, for me, at most a 2/5.",

They wanted to easily pull the new generations into their paid seats, so they turned it into the Zendaya and big worms show (Go, queen!).Chani, the real character, is pivotal for the complete story of Dune, but here they killed her in favor of Zendaya's bad acting as a 21 century teenager who has spent too much time on Youtube's echo-chambers watching videos about the patriarchy and how Israel and the Illuminati wants to control all minorities.In Herbert's book, and in the reality of a culture directly descendent from Islam like the Fremen, Chani would have died immediately after slapping the just proven Lisan al-Gaib. But, also, in those situations, Chani would have NEVER dared to raise her hand, or even have an opinion against the Lisan al-Gaib because the whole point of the Fremen is that they are unified by the cruel environment they live in. They have no time to ponder if their religion is true or false. In fact, there would be no way to have anybody doubt what the Bene Gesserit planted millennia ago. That's what made the Fremen ripe to be controlled by a Messiah figure, and that was what Herbert intended to demonstrate as a danger for humanity.And where the hell is Alia? One of the most unique and incredible characters ever made for fiction? How will she, if ever, become St. Alia of the Knife if she was robbed from her glory in the battle of Arrakeen?Where are the CHOAM and the Spacing Guild?As an isolated science fiction movie, it is impressive, as a Dune adaptation it's enraging.Imagine LOTR, but Sam is a kick-ass girl Hobbit warrior that in the end kills Sauron in battle because Frodo, wimp male-Hobbit that he is, lost the ring to Golum.I give a 10 as a production, and take away 5 for mauling the story in favor of an actress and society's imagined hypersensitivity.",

It was the best movie by far I've seen at cinema in a long time. I would watch this film again and again and again. If you're thinking of seeing this film I highly recommend it in IMAX, the thumper sounds are epic and the sheer scale of the world. Just go see it!!!!!!",

    "Review Content": "Dune Part Two\" continues the epic saga with impeccable casting and a masterfully crafted screenplay that captivates audiences from start to finish. The film, directed by Denis Villeneuve, seamlessly picks up where its predecessor left off, delivering a visually stunning and emotionally resonant experience.One of the standout aspects of the movie is its exceptional casting. Timothée Chalamet as Paul Atreides delivers a nuanced and compelling performance, showcasing his versatility as an actor. Chalamet's portrayal of Paul's internal struggles and growth adds depth to the character, making him a central figure that audiences can empathize with.The supporting cast is equally praiseworthy, with performances by Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, and Zendaya elevating the overall ensemble. Ferguson's portrayal of Lady Jessica brings a powerful and complex dimension to the character, while Isaac's portrayal of Duke Leto Atreides adds gravitas to the narrative. Zendaya's role as Chani is ethereal and captivating, creating a chemistry with Chalamet that enhances the emotional impact of the story.The screenplay, adapted from Frank Herbert's seminal novel, is a triumph of storytelling. Screenwriter Jon Spaihts, along with Villeneuve, skillfully navigates the intricate plot, maintaining a delicate balance between world-building and character development. The narrative unfolds organically, allowing the audience to immerse themselves in the rich universe of \"Dune.\"Visually, the film is a feast for the eyes. Cinematographer Greig Fraser captures the vast, sweeping landscapes of Arrakis with breathtaking precision. The desert scenes, in particular, are both awe-inspiring and foreboding, setting the tone for the challenges that await the characters.Hans Zimmer's musical score complements the visuals, heightening the tension and emotion of each scene. The combination of Zimmer's evocative score and the striking visuals creates a cinematic experience that is both visceral and emotionally resonant.\"Dune Part Two\" stands as a testament to the successful adaptation of a beloved science fiction masterpiece. It not only honors the source material but also expands upon it, offering a visually stunning and emotionally gripping cinematic experience. As the second installment in what promises to be a landmark film series, \"Dune Part Two\" solidifies itself as a triumph in casting, screenplay, and overall storytelling.",

Chani's misery was overblown and her disgruntled face spoiled the beginning, middle and end of the movie. Otherwise, it is a beautiful piece of writing. Harkonnen vibes 10/10. The movie could have ended with absolutely any shot: Paul, the worm, the mouse, the rock, the moon...but no, we're shown a completely inappropriate face of resentment as if the whole story was about her and we watched 5 hours of these 2 movies for her sake. Seriously, it's like a beautiful cake with a rotten cherry on top. If it wasn't for that, the score would be 12/10.",

    "Review Date": "2024-03-02",
    "Review Content": "Imagine you lived in the '60s and someone produced the first IMAX experience for Lawrence of Arabia. How shocked would you have been? How great of a cinematic experience would you have thought it was had that existed in the '60s?This is what Dune Part 2 made me feel, but better. Villeneuve, Fraser, and Zimmer have adapted the brilliant and intricate story of Arrakis and have scaled it to a level you've never seen before unless mentioned in the breath of The Lord of the Rings among others. The Arrakis we see feels so visceral, so tangible, we feel like we are there with the Fremen and live among them.Villeneuve didn't care too much for the action sequences, but rather the substance and depth of Paul Atreides' arc. To have this rather than being bombarded with action scenes for two hours like the typical IMAX experience feels so refreshing and shows why Denis Villeneuve is such a film purist. This is the essence of cinema: great cinematographic sequences where every single frame can be captured and hung in The Louvre and every single frame has the depth to tell a thousand meanings and has to be seen multiple times.Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Zendaya, Austin Butler, Javier Bardem, every single cast member put everything into their roles and its the most sensational thing you'll ever see. There's a scene that Chalamet is the heart of and it'll make your jaw drops. He certainly is the future of Hollywood.Thank you Denis Villeneuve for creating an experience I will carry with me for the rest of my life.",

You will be impressed by the transformation of Lady Jessica. Before the movie got released, I was concerned that the main storyline will be diluted by involving in the new characters. However, after I watched the movie, the new characters (like the emperor and his daughter) shine in their own way and add more spices to the main storyline. What is pity is that I hope the war part can be a bit longer, and the fight between Paul and his cousin can be more intense.",

It wasn't perfect but when you spend almost 3 hours in a theater and never once want to leave your seat... We had 9 people in our group and everyone loved it so that is another reason for the 10/10. Ages 13-57 male and female. I've never read the books so I can't critique from that point of view, but after watching part 2 now I want to order the books and hopefully refrain from reading the last one until after part 3 is released.",

    "Review Date": "2024-03-06",
    "Review Content": "There's been a lot of hyperbole and superlatives about this movie since it released. While it is a solid, entertaining sci fi movie, labeling it the GOAT or anything similar to that, is just people fanning out over it. Maybe it's just the time that we're living in now, where people are prisoners of the moment far too often but I remember a time when it took something way more groundbreaking than what this movie offers to call it the greatest sci fi movie of all time. There's really nothing \"special\" about it. Sure, the cinematography is strong and some of the action scenes are very entertaining but there's nothing crazy innovative about this film. It's a sort of paint by the numbers - messiah type tale. The chemistry between zendaya and chalamet is really good and Butler turns in a solid turn as the villain. But outside of that, there's nothing that's gonna etch this movie in the sands of time, imo. I remember when The Matrix came out and seeing that in theaters and being completely mind blown by it!!! I had never seen anything like that before. It may be unfair but that'll be a standard I'll hold any movie vying for \"best sci fi film of all time\" to until my last days as a film watcher. This is a solid movie but don't buy into the hype, temper your expectations and you'll enjoy it just fine.Definitely a film that is more enjoyable on a large screen with great surround sound. The director and his crew set up some really great looking shots that are best enjoyed on a large screen. With that said, the score and visual aesthetic is very one note and drab. Which, I get it, it's part of the mood and tone the director is going for. But for me it's very sterile and cold. Not an insane fun, hold on to the seat of your pants type film with a ROUSING score that gets you hyped for the action that's unfolding before you. Having seen Dune Part One recently, it's not that I necessarily expected that from this movie but when I heard the \"goat\" word being thrown around, it did raise my expectations of what we'd see on the screen.Again, a fine film but nothing genre defining imo. One of those that you can watch once and you'll be fine with lol. Unlike the best of this genre where you can't wait to rewatch it over and over and over again...Where the action is unlike anything you've ever seen, the characters are rich and layered, and likable figures. The score is fun and captivating even if it's a dark one. You go and tell everyone that they need to watch this movie ASAP. In my book, that's the TRUE definition of any films that look to call themselves the greatest sci fi film of all time.",

It's an experience.Is it confusing? Even though the movie touched on Herbert's idea of politics and religion, but Denis carried us through seamlessly. Not even a boring part exists, as I believe that there are more difficult and challenging materials.

    "Review Content": "I think Dune: Part 2 is one of the most phenomenal movies I've seen. I was hyped and everything said pre-release is true. It seriously blew the first film out of the water in every way with how good it was. Dennis Villeneuve is quickly becoming one of my favorite directors. On an unrelated note, I watched Enemy and Incendies by him last week with the latter being particularly great. Sicario along with Dune: Part 2 is also one of my favorite movies, which the same director did also. Anyways, back to the spectacle. No spoilers but they did a cool Easter egg reference if you've seen Blue Velvet (my favorite movie of all time), since David Lynch directed the first version of Dune. The first movie I thought was great, but you'd have to be a fan as it was a little slower. That one really felt like the prologue, but this was the real deal. Dune: Part 2 was consistently intense on the action front and truly a masterclass work. It certainly doesn't hurt that Zendaya, Christopher Walken, and Javier Bardem are all among my favorite actors. I plan on catching this a few times while it's in theaters. It really is that great.",

You get a true Masterpiece of its time! Dune saga can grow to be the sci-fi saga that everyone remembers, talks about as the mark of how to make good sci fi/fantasy story. This movie (both parts) is up there among best ever made movies. A must watch, not only for sci-fi fans but for everyone!And finally a sci-fi/fantasy movie of class with loads of depth for the more adult audience.(A comment I overheard by some very excited and loud teens just after the movie. \"How the **** can u make a movie this good from a 65 years old book, and to that a sci fi movie!\")",

Austin Butler almost sheds his Elvis persona and gives a captivating performance. Timothee Chalamet is on his best form and gets better with everything he does. Christopher Walken can't help but be Christopher Walken, but hey why not! The screen is always full of energy and each frame is masterful.

Also, the movie never held your hand when it came to the storytelling.

So with that said, I think this movie was a very well written movie.Honestly, this movie feels like it's on the same epic scale of The Lord of the Rings movies for this \"era\".I really enjoyed this installment and I'm excited for part 3!

When a movie has so much information and content, it's hard for it to trigger any emotions because so many scenes move along so quicklyWhile watching the movie, after every scene, you'd think that it's just days going by but in actuality, the story is progressing by weeks and even months at a time.Great movie overall, the rushness of it was the only issue that I had.",

    "Review Date": "2024-03-03",
    "Review Content": "I'm giving this film a 10 out of 10. I think both parts together amount to a 9.5 overall and I gave a 9 to part 1. But as a book fan I feel frustrated.The film, as a film, is excellent. A true work of art that has everything we can ask of an epic movie: great characters, great plot, a satisfying conclusion, epic action scenes, mystical and ominous scenes, etc. On top of that, the visual aspect and the soundtrack are extraordinary. It's one of those movies that is at the same time a work of art and has mass appeal. Watch it in the best cinema you can because the cinema experience really is different from the TV experience at home.As a book fan, though, I'm frustrated. I know Denis Villeneuve had an extremely difficult task. This book is notoriously difficult to adapt. And he was probably very frustrated by the things he had to leave out as well.So I can't judge him harshly except on one thing: he refuses to make extended cuts. I understand that stance when it comes to normal movies but when adapting iconic books that stance is not tenable. And there's great precedent with the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Dune is an extraordinary film as such, but as an adaptation I can't say it's extraordinary. So I absolutely think he should work on extended cuts after finishing Dune Messiah.Specifically I am frustrated by the absence of mentats, especially of Tufir Hawat, the absence of Count Fenring, and of the navigators. Not to mention many subplots and scenes but I understand time is limited. Most people are going to have a problem with Alia but I'm ok with what Villeneuve did because it's nearly impossible to adapt her well anyway. I thought what he did with Alia was ingenious and fascinating in its own way.But I am especially frustrated with the portrayal of Lady Jessica. I was forgiving of Part 1's flaws in her portrayal but now that I've seen part 2 I'm actually disappointed with how she was basically made a villain in part 2. I understand the need to emphasise that the Bene Gesserit are the great manipulators of politics in Dune but Lady Jessica was also a rebel against the Bene Gesserit. She was more good than evil, much like Paul and his father. Yet in the movies she's too emotional in part 1 and too manipulative/villainous in part 2.Finally, for the unpopular opinion. I understand not liking Zendaya, but I think people's dislike of her is blinding them to Chani's character. I thought she did have chemistry with Paul. I thought Villeneuve did a good job fleshing out Chani because she's a bit one dimensional in the books. I understood why she stormed out of the room at the end, she was publicly humiliated and hurt by Paul. However I thought the last scene was not the best to end on. It's understandable and supposed to represent not only Chani's personal pain, but also the pain of people who were rooting for Paul to be able to avoid the holy war and instead watch him transform into someone different. Yet it's not the best scene to end this epic on.But overall I loved the movie, I can't wait for Dune Messiah, and I really hope Villeneuve changes his mind about extended cuts.",

Like in Blade Runner 2049 or Arrival, or even Dune part 1.But this time, the emotional touches were forced and felt fake.Why are the fremens always crying and throwing sand to their faces? Herbert's Dune describes Fremen as resilient and independent people who carry themselves with high disgnity, so why is the movie showing them with such a low dignity? Always crying, complaining and screaming?.\nBene gesserit sisters depiction is spot on, however, many in the audience might not understand them fully because they arent explained in depth in the movies. Only the book readers could appreciate the bene gesserit scenes..\nThe entire movie was action scenes, the books are what they are because of the complex storyline that wasnt paid enough attention to in the movies..\nGenerally speaking, this is the worst movie Villeneuve has made alongside his much earlier works like Enemy.A bit disappointed, I expected more.Legendary books mixed with a legendary director shouldnt equal such boredom!!!",

This is easily one of the best movies I've ever watched, though. I'm now going with more friends and I'm watching it again tonight. It is completely worth it to see this movie!!!",

    "Review Content": "The movie is a more impressive, more exciting and deeper production than the first part. Give it 9 out of 10.The acting, visual effects, music and atmosphere in the movie are amazing. Paul's evolution is perfectly demonstrated by Timothée Chalamet.The visual effects deliver a breathtaking rendering of Arrakis' desert landscapes, giant worms, and battle scenes. You can smell the scent of a spice behind curtain.Music adds soul to the film with the mastery of Hans Zimmer. The atmosphere is to keep tension and emotion at a high level throughout the film.While the film's script remains faithful to the book, it also offers some differences. While some changes make the film better, others do not fit the spirit of the book. However, I can honestly say that the changes made do not harm the film at all.Dune: Part Two is one of the masterpieces of science fiction cinema. It's the best movie I've seen in nearly 15 years. Maybe Oppenheimer.Nah, this movie is better.",

    "Review Content": "The evocation of a fantastic, exotic future was powerful. The combat action ranging from blowing up giant machines to single combat with knives was exciting. Up until the point where Paul wakes up after drinking the spice, he was admirable and both he and Chani were very likable.The only reason why i didn't give Part 2 a 10 was that No drug such as Arrakin spice and whatever else is in the blue Water of Life--taken once that can cause a permanent major character change. Before he drank the blue substance, Paul was deadset against the idea that he was a savior, deadset against igniting a fundamentalist revolution that would result in the death of Billions of people, whether human or non-human. Suddenly afterwards, he transforms into an arrogant dictator who abandons his previously claimed undying love for Chani by declaring he will marry the daughter of the Emperor, thereby allowing him to rule the known universe. OK, i happen to already know more than is in part 2, that he will ignite that revolution that ends with the death of Billions or Trillions. All from taking a drug once. That's not possible.",

The sound design and the technical aspects of this film are a WORK OF ART, and this aspect will surely be recognised at the next OSCARS. Very solid acting too, the sensations left after the film are surely unique and breathtaking. After you stand up from your seat at the cinema you'll immediately feel the impression that you just watched an instant classic, just like after Lord of the Rings or a true Star Wars.

First of all , the cinematography and the costuming of this film is impeccable, like the Middle Eastern influence is there and I love it ( I know it's heavenly inspired by the Arabic world ). In this part , we explore the relationship between the two main characters which is a rollercoaster of emotions as the story progresses. Oh girl , a rollercoaster indeed. Now let's talk about the villains : aside from the great make up , we got more in depth about the division of the empire and the madness of Harkonens. Boy , this Vegita like villain made the film even greater than it was. Pity that it will not be the main thing for part 3. Finally , Zendaya was great , in my opinion she is in her post apocalyptic era and we are here for it , especially after the final scene.",

The acting is wonderful, the visuals stunning and the soundtrack almost blew me out my seat more than once. I've always had a soft spot for the David Lynch version and there are elements of that movie I would have loved to see here (weirding weapons for instance) grand in scope that it is, the lynch version for me does a better job of showcasing a greater scale and scope of the overall universe albeit in 80s style. I have one or two other minor gripes also, I felt the pacing was off in moments, almost like scenes had been abruptly removed, we seemed to get to big moments in the story just by cut to black in one moment and there the next with no explanation. Also, the villains are sorely under used in my opinion and fail to live up to their name, each meeting their end in a rather underwhelming way. Raban, poor Raban was reduced to a comic villain in the end. Anyway, despite that I loved the movie, it was epic and by far the best thing I have seen in a cinema for many many years. I hope we get to see the conclusion of the trilogy and an end to the what will then be the best movie trilogy of a lifetime.",

    "Review Content": "If you didn't read the Dune books and did not see the Dune movie from the 1980's then you will love the grandiose spectacle created with such an immense budget. Go see the movie or read the 9 and 10 star reviews to find out more if you require a complete and detailed synopsis before you can commit to watching a movie. You can stop reading here.If you read the book and/or saw the movie from the 1980's then you will feel 5 stars or less is appropriate, depending on how disappointed all the negative aspects leave you. For this demographic I will explain why I don't believe it is the best movie ever made as others so excitedly proclaim.1. Made the same time as part 1 but delayed for 2 years because WB wanted massive marketing to sell it. Last 2 part movie I will ever go see in the theater.2. Part 1 was a long, drawn out bore fest for me when I saw it in the theater only to find out that it was only an intro to part 2. I include this because it is, in fact, part of this book and part of the story and part of the total experience.3. Dune Part 2 leaves out main characters, main story arcs and in addition to being a very great disappointment for that reason, would impact any supposed Part 3 of the story in an even more dramatic separation from the books.4. Deception by WB in two ways. First, spreading rumors of a part 3 so people will want to see this one feeling it will be an ongoing franchise like star wars or LOTR. Considering how long it took to release part 2 when it was filmed years ago, expect any part 3 to come out around 2030 or later. Secondly, this movie had 9.8 rating on IMDb before it was even released, with that number cited in numerous professional reviews and TV shows. Don't need a private detective to know they were fake or paid or friends and family of those involved with WB and/or the production. Or is it really the greatest movie ever to be made in the history of Cinema? Lol I understand, they need to recoup 200 million plus another billion in profit.5. For me, its just too long to sit through. I admit I fell asleep during the Part 1 it was so boring. Maybe because I did know the story. Also, the sound was overwhelmingly loud, I was regretting not bringing ear plugs to the theater with me. Don't ever bring a young child to the theater to see this movie as it might damage their hearing.For me its a one star because of the reasons I listed above and the fact that its just another remake anyway, nothing new here. But I realize that for many, spectacular special effects and action on a grandiose scale is what movie watching is all about, and of course it being the GOAT movie and worthy of a 10. (that's probably most of the audience and professional reviewers these days) Some times the story and especially conforming to a book, is irrelevant to the audience, so I split the difference with my rating.My suggestion: if you have MAX then wait until it is released there in a few months.Hopefully you appreciate an honest review with absolutely no detailed synopsis to spoil it for you.",

    "Review Date": "2024-03-04",
    "Review Content": "The first movie was a cinematic feast with beautifully framed wide shots and lots of broad panning views of battles and gorgeous scenery in the desert. This movie absolutely delivers more of that fantastic cinematography that is so thoughtfully shot with natural lighting using the desert sun at various times of day and angles. It's immersive and just an incredible feat of filmmaking. While other fantastic sequels like Empire really offer a dramatic change of scenery and costumes for our main characters (eg. Hoth, Cloud City), this sequel mostly takes place in the same place. But instead of just feeling like more of the same it builds on what the first film introduced, revealing more detail about the Fremen's underground dwellings and places of worship and taking us to the southern part of the planet. We see more of the Harkonnen home world and get a better taste of that blood-thirsty culture. Austin Butler's character introduces us to someone new, interesting, and frightening. Paul and Jessica's evolution throughout this movie from the end of the first film to the end of this one leave us in a very different place with their characters. And (having myself not read the book) some of the plot twists we learn about are reminiscent of the great plot twists in Star Wars, which made the inspiration Dune had on George Lucas even more apparent. The movie is long, but I often found myself hoping it wouldn't end where I thought it might and it kept going until giving us a very satisfying epic battle and full development of the characters to set the stage for the third film. I left feeling really satisfied with the experience and will definitely see it again. It was a rare sequel that did not disappoint and delivered on everything the first film promised.",

And good actors.... Still.... Cristophfer Walker kisses Paul's hand and that's it? So much? Why so much promotion when the first screening is much more packed with content? To me this is proof that fools have crept in everywhere, even in the most unexpected places. Where are the scenes with Paul Atreides' sister? Where is the confrontation with the Bene Gesserit? I wonder if the director read the books or just had a secondhand script written by someone who had no idea they were working on a screen adaptation of a book...even more. He could extract the essence and all that was uplifting in the story. I am extremely angry. Someone spent a lot of money on a movie that I couldn't wait to see because I knew it was an adaptation of some books that really impressed me but I was tricked into seeing a very nicely packaged mess... . .. The packaging was perfect but inside.......nothing....and what a promotion....... I now understand that in addition to the fake news and somehow fashionable now....it must I also expect fake movies. Sure, a director can create wonders with a bad script, together with exceptional actors. What was missing from this film production? The script was written after fabulous books.....books of undisputed worldwide success. The technical team was top notch. Where did it go wrong and who is the sucker in the equation that ruined everything? Remove the special effects from the film and see what you're left with....with nothing that can be compared to the original story...and this idea of Muslim religious fanaticism...this rude reference to images familiar to TV news somehow. ......he wants to be what? The book exploits feelings triggered by a beautiful, uplifting story, capable of awakening something in anyone. This movie, however, only makes me appreciate the special effects and feel sorry for the stupid exceptional actors to participate in the deception.",

To start with, and that's probably the (my) problem, I'm a Lynch (never really liked his Dune movie though), Kubrick, Nolan movie nerd. I loved Villeneuve's Dune Part One because it was different than most other Popcorn Sci-Fi movies from recent years (with few exceptions) and I have to mention here I'm a Villeneuve fan. Arrival is one, if not THE best, \"they are here\" movie of all time. Finally someone who makes Sci-Fi movies for adults... I felt the same way with Dune Part One: Calm, mysterious, dark and every sequence looked like an oil painting. Pure modern movie art! What we get in Part Two, I'm afraid to say, is not far from what we got with Star Wars I-III back in the days. Yes, far more advanced and visuals, sound design, score made to perfection (hence the 6-star rating) BUT the story and its execution on film is a huge disappointment! Close to 3 hours (and I love long movies) of annoying love story (we saw that coming in Part One), worm riding(!!), Paul-frowning/hesitation, repetitious and lame dialogues, some Action sequences to keep the audience awake and a climax which isn't interesting and leads to nowhere. As always I felt like a director wants to make a sequel, desperately tries to top the first installment, puts in the whole nine yards (bigger, louder, longer) and is very (too) considered to make sure it reaches the biggest audience possible to guarantee a box office hit ...but forgets to tell an interesting story. Gone is the originality, authenticity, creativity and new approach which made me fall in love with a movie which is different and genuine. I went to the movies last night with great expectations and somehow lost interest after an hour which made me kinda sad cause it confirmed what I say after pretty much every sequel since 30 years: \"too bad, they ruined it...\". I definitely won't go for a 3rd part and rather look out for something new and original like Poor Things. Villeneuve lost me on this one but I will be back when he comes up with something NEW.",

The answer might vary, but if we reverse the perspective, we might come to a concise answer: an exceptional experience. An indescribable feeling, adrenaline rushing through our veins, breaths taken away. These collective sensations can't fully express my admiration for the experience I lived through in \"Dune Part II.\"What makes Dune Part II an exceptional film?The Story: Adapted from Frank Herbert's novel \"Dune.\" Considered one of the most important science fiction novels, it has won numerous awards, been translated into over 20 languages, and sold over 20 million copies worldwide.The Screenplay: Maintains depth of characters and connects them with skillfully crafted dialogue. It simplifies the complexities of the world of \"Dune,\" facilitating engagement between viewers and the world of events.The Acting: A stellar cast of Hollywood's finest. Timothy Chalamet shines in his performance, especially in two scenes with the climax sequence.Direction: Creative work by Denis Villeneuve. Transforming the film into an artistic masterpiece, every frame could become a work of art.Music: Hans Zimmer's genius. Enchanting music enhances the beauty of the scenes.Sound Design: Everything related to sound was amazing.Visual Effects: 10 out of 10. Feeling like the film is a documentary due to the realism of the scenes. Costume design and locations are integral.Am I exaggerating in my assessment?I don't believe so. I feel that this film will be one of the most important films in history. A masterpiece that will increase in stature over time.Tip:For maximum enjoyment, I recommend watching \"Dune Part II\" on the biggest screen possible, preferably in IMAX cinema.

They made the mom a scheming witch, who forgets her husband, and manipulates her son. They made his wife his enemy, who hates her own people's faith and hope. The emperor was barely developed, it was more about his daughter (no doubt DEI influence here). There was no space folding, or weird creatures. The bad guys were the heroes in this film, they had more words and better characters. It's like the people who did this hate religion, a core part of the story. I am not seeing Dune III. I'm tired of seeing my favorite films re-written without the core parts that made them great films to begin with. I think we need an alternative to the studio system. They love to make money off fan favorites, but hate the films we love, and they work to wreck them, so no one likes them. I used to love movies, now there are no movies to love. If you loved Dune, don't see this film. It's a shadow of the first one. The supernatural stuff and the science fiction technology is stripped from this film.

Don't get me wrong, the acting is really, really good, but I felt the character evolution could have been better portrayed. More specifically :I did not feel real chemistry between Chani and Paul throughout the movie, and I felt their strory felt a bit rushed (e.g. Chani suddenly loses her bestial side in the scene where they're in the tent and she takes care of him after a bad dream)I thought Paul's change after he drinks the water of life and becomes the Kwisatz Haderach was not on par with what I pictured in my mind while reading the book. I would have expected Chalamet's acting to better reflect Paul becoming omniscient and foreseeing. I felt he did not manage to be as convincing throughout the late part of the movie as he was in the scene where he is recognised as Muad'Dib by all the Fremen (which was amazing).So overall, I felt that the picture and the sound where so insanely exceptional that they ended up dwarfing Chalamet and Zendaya's performances.",

I think people will critique the fast pace in the last quarter but it's conceptual towards the nature of the story, the approaching war and death was coming fast, you needed to feel that, they need the people on his side fast because this, therefore also his flip flop with emotion and power and belief would be all over, his house but also love for others, lead him to a combination of beliefs, will makes it seem like all of sudden he's his house again but that's always there. Which is why Zendayas character is pissed, it took a lot for her to accept him, but she need him to be all hers. All the whole story is about power play and for you the viewer to question morals.",

    "Review Content": "I was highly anticipating this movie and I can wholeheartedly say that it did not disappoint. From the brilliant visual effects to the incredible performances, this movie is one of the best sequels that I have ever seen.Timothée Chalamet really stood up in this film by portraying Paul in such a powerful and mesmerizing way that it leaves you wondering what kind of character Paul Atreides really is. I found myself rooting for him in the beginning of the movie, but by the end of it, I started questioning his choices and wondering if this was \"the only way\" or if he got power hungry in this whole process.Another powerful performance was from Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha. He was scary, he was fearless, and he was visually the most interesting actor to look at.I can't write a proper review for Dune 2 without talking about Denis Villeneuve, the person who made it all possible. I think he is a brilliant director that continues to surprise us with his craft. I really hope we will get the chance to see Dune Messiah directed by Denis Villeneuve.",

    "Review Content": "Dune Part 2\" stands as a cinematic colossus, marking a milestone in the evolution of science fiction film adaptations. Masterfully directed, this sequel not only captures the immersive and complex essence of Frank Herbert's original material but also elevates the narrative to a new level of visual and emotional splendor.From the outset, the director demonstrates a profound understanding of the narrative, choosing to expand the story in ways that complement and enrich what was established in the first part. While \"Dune Part 1\" took liberties in incorporating an extensive introduction, this risky decision lays the groundwork for the vast world and complex characters now explored with greater depth. In \"Dune Part 2,\" this world unfolds with overwhelming beauty, captivating the viewer in its vastness and intricacy.The cast shines brightly, with each actor embodying their character with a mix of vulnerability and strength that is seldom seen. The characters are well-developed, showing convincing growth arcs that reflect the central themes of power, destiny, and humanity that Herbert wove into his work. This depth of characterization ensures that \"Dune Part 2\" is not just a visual experience but also one that resonates emotionally.The art direction and visual effects are of stellar quality, creating desert landscapes that are both majestic and relentless. The attention to detail in each scene, from the vast sand dunes to the intricate designs of the spaceships and costumes, transports the viewer to a world that, though alien, feels tangible and real. The cinematography masterfully captures this splendor, using a color palette that reflects both the beauty and brutality of the Dune universe.The sound design and soundtrack play a crucial role in immersing the viewer. The vibrant and enveloping sound not only complements the magnitude of the visual scenes but also deepens the emotional connection with the story. The music, both ethereal and powerful, elevates every moment, from epic battles to tension-filled silences, creating an auditory experience as impactful as the visual one.\"Dune Part 2\" not only meets the expectations set by its predecessor but surpasses them, establishing itself as a masterpiece in its own right. The film delves into complex themes with a maturity and depth seldom seen in science fiction cinema. The exploration of politics, religion, and ecology, central themes in Herbert's book, is handled with subtlety and complexity that enriches the narrative, inviting reflection.In conclusion, \"Dune Part 2\" is a cinematic feat that not only honors Herbert's vision but also expands it in exciting and meaningful ways. It is a film that is not only enjoyable in the moment but also endures, inviting reflection and debate long after the final credits have rolled. With its combination of profound narrative, stellar performances, and impressive technical achievements, this film will surely be remembered as a modern classic and a benchmark in science fiction cinema.",

    "Review Content": "Dune Part 2 is truly amazing in terms of story, music, visuals and characters. The film is almost 3 hours long but it doesn't feel like it because the storyline is not boring and each character is also not wasted. A masterpiece in the midst of superhero films that are starting to get bored and have no clear direction. As a sequel dune 2 starts the story without missing a beat. Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) and his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), continue their adventure on the desert planet Arrakis.Out of the clutches of the Harkonnen, they try to join the Fremen, including Chani (Zendaya), who appeared several times in Paul's dreams in the first film. As Paul tries to understand their customs, Lady Jessica tells the Fremen that her son is the leader they have been waiting for according to the prophecy.Denis Villeneuve succeeded in presenting perfect details. The worlds he creates are stunning, from the desert of Arrakis to majestic palaces. The appearance of giant sandworms and neatly choreographed battle scenes are entertainment for those who enjoy the sci-fi action genre. Villeneuve succeeded in transforming the visuals from Frank Herbert's novel beautifully in every scene.Dune 2 also presents deep and interesting characters. Timothee Chalamet takes Paul Atreides to new heights with a compelling performance, just the right amount of charismatic and intimidating, conveying the complexity of Paul's character ideally. Zendaya, who previously only appeared a few times in Dune: Part One, now has the opportunity to explore Chani's character as a strong and brave figure.The presence of supporting roles such as Lady Jessica and Princess Irula (Florence Pugh) also adds to the complexity of the political complexities in the world created by Villeneuve. Javier Bardem as Stilgar also gave an extraordinary performance that will stick in the audience's memory. Likewise, Austin Butler, who previously impressed through Elvis (2022), again displays his eccentric and memorable role.",

However, some viewers may observe a missed opportunity in not consulting or including cast members from a Bedouin background, especially considering the filming locations in areas like Wadi Rum in Jordan and the Arabian Desert, which are central to the novel. There are instances of Arabic phrases in the movie, but it appears that the transcript writers may not have a proficient understanding of the language.

However the first film was paced perfectly, a slow-burn that took its time to develop the plot & suspense. The second had a lot to pack into the second half of the novel, & like the worms, hurtled across the plot at breakneck speed to reach the conclusion.I'd have preferred a trilogy, with more plot development - diving with the worm beneath the sand - So to speak.Awesome visuals, incredibly impressive but only a cursory salute to fans of the novels to keep the general public happy! Some breathtaking moments, but little plot development to show the context of the character or plot development.

    "Review Content": "Dune 2\" triumphantly returns us to the desolate yet mesmerizing landscapes of Arrakis, continuing the epic saga with a narrative depth and visual splendor that surpasses its predecessor. Director Denis Villeneuve masterfully escalates the stakes, weaving a tale of power, betrayal, and destiny that is as intellectually stimulating as it is emotionally gripping.The film's pacing is deliberate, each scene meticulously crafted to deepen the story's complexities and the characters' journeys. Timothée Chalamet reprises his role as Paul Atreides with a performance that is both vulnerable and commanding, embodying the weight of prophecy and leadership with nuanced grace. The ensemble cast, including Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, and newcomers that bring fresh intrigue and dynamics, delivers performances that are profoundly compelling, enriching the narrative's multifaceted themes.Visually, \"Dune 2\" is nothing short of spectacular. Villeneuve, alongside cinematographer Greig Fraser, captures the alien beauty of Arrakis with awe-inspiring shots that are both vast in scale and intimate in detail. The special effects are seamlessly integrated, enhancing the storytelling without overshadowing it, and the score by Hans Zimmer is as haunting as it is exhilarating, further immersing the audience in the film's atmospheric world.Narratively, the sequel expands the Dune universe with a deft hand, exploring the political machinations, cultural depth, and ecological mysteries of Arrakis with a sophistication that is rare in science fiction cinema. The film's exploration of themes such as leadership, sacrifice, and ecological stewardship are timely and thought-provoking, inviting viewers to reflect on parallels within our own world.If there's an area where \"Dune 2\" could improve, it might be in offering even more screen time to its supporting characters, whose backstories and motivations beg for deeper exploration. Nonetheless, this is a minor critique in an otherwise exceptional film.In conclusion, \"Dune 2\" is a cinematic masterpiece that not only honors Frank Herbert's legacy but also pushes the boundaries of what science fiction can achieve on the big screen. It is a visually stunning, emotionally resonant, and intellectually rewarding experience that sets a new benchmark for the genre. As the credits roll, one can't help but eagerly anticipate the next chapter in this breathtaking saga.",

Yes the visual effects are incredible but some of the acting feels flat or forced (especially with Zendaya's character) and the dialog is predictable.The story itself feels predictable.Outsiders exploiting a valuable natural resource in a distant land without regard for the natives or the planet.Outsider male joins up with the natives to learn their ways and become like them to help. Falls in love with native female. Reluctant to step into a leadership role, and regarded suspiciously at first by the locals, he eventually wins everyone over and shows he can lead the people.Outsider army uses overwhelming firepower to destroy an important native location. Cue the refugee scenes.Hero unites the people behind his plan and saves the day.When Avatar did all this it was (rightfully) criticized for being a Fern Gully/Dances With Wolves rip off.I get that Frank Herbert wrote this a long time ago, but some of these movie tropes feel very recycled. There has to be a better way to reimagine some of these similar storylines.Hans Zimmer remains a musical genius, but is there nothing else that works in these epic movies than the \"duuuun dun\" booming sounds?",

But luckily, it stays realistic and there are no signs of an unrealistic \"Disney/Marvel\" kind of magic like \"the Force\" or \"\"Quantum Worlds\". You can actually feel that this might be our future in about 10.000 years from now and when the movie was finished, I had the same kind of feeling after I saw the sequel of the Godfather, the Matrix, Batman and the Lord of the Rings.

    "Review Content": "Dune: Part Two\" emerges as a cinematic tour de force, encapsulating the essence of Frank Herbert's classic with an execution that can only be described as visually and auditorially mesmerizing. Director Denis Villeneuve's vision transcends the confines of traditional science fiction, elevating this film into a realm of unparalleled immersion, where the desolate beauty of Arrakis and the intricate complexities of Herbert's universe are brought to life with staggering clarity and emotional depth.The visuals in \"Dune: Part Two\" are nothing short of breathtaking. Villeneuve, along with cinematographer Greig Fraser, crafts a visual palette that is as vast and sweeping as the dunes themselves. Each frame is a meticulously designed masterpiece, capturing the stark beauty of the desert landscape, the opulence of the imperial court, and the visceral intensity of the Fremen's struggle. The use of practical effects, augmented by judicious CGI, creates a tactile realism that grounds the story's fantastical elements in a palpable reality. The sweeping shots of Arrakis's desert, the intricate designs of the spaceships and technology, and the hauntingly beautiful Sietches of the Fremen are rendered with such detail and care that they become characters in their own right.Hans Zimmer's score complements the visuals to create an immersive experience that is truly extraordinary. His music for \"Dune: Part Two\" is both haunting and evocative, weaving traditional Middle Eastern motifs with futuristic synths to underscore the film's themes of destiny, power, and transformation. The score ebbs and flows with the narrative, amplifying the emotional resonance of key moments, from the thunderous clashes of battle to the intimate whispers of prophecy. Zimmer's ability to capture the soul of Herbert's universe in his compositions adds a layer of depth to the film that transcends the visual spectacle, ensnaring the audience in a sensory embrace that is both exhilarating and deeply moving.For fans of the original novels, \"Dune: Part Two\" offers a nuanced interpretation of Paul Atreides' journey that both honors and challenges Herbert's intentions. In the books, particularly in \"Dune Messiah,\" Herbert sought to subvert the traditional hero's journey by presenting Paul as a deeply flawed figure, whose rise to power brings about not salvation but suffering. This film bravely embraces that complexity, depicting Paul not as the unblemished hero many have come to expect but as a young man grappling with the weight of prophecy, the seductions of power, and the moral ambiguities of his actions.This portrayal of Paul is a bold narrative choice, reflecting a deeper understanding of Herbert's critique of the hero myth. By emphasizing Paul's darker impulses and the consequences of his decisions, \"Dune: Part Two\" challenges viewers to reconsider their perceptions of leadership, heroism, and destiny. It's a testament to Timothée Chalamet's performance that Paul remains a compelling, if increasingly troubled, protagonist. Chalamet captures the internal conflict of a character caught between destiny and desire, bringing a nuanced depth to Paul that is both captivating and unsettling.The decision to delve into the darker aspects of Paul's character aligns with Herbert's own reflections on the misinterpretation of \"Dune.\" Herbert was concerned that readers glorified Paul as a hero, missing the cautionary tale of power and its pitfalls. This film rectifies that, presenting a vision of Paul that is more in line with Herbert's intentions, and in doing so, enriches the narrative with complexity and ambiguity.\"Dune: Part Two\" is a masterful continuation of Villeneuve's adaptation, a film that not only captures the grandeur and majesty of Herbert's universe but also engages with its most challenging themes. The combination of stunning visuals, a captivating score, and a willingness to explore the moral complexities of its protagonist makes this film a remarkable achievement. It's a cinematic experience that not only entertains but also invites reflection on the nature of power, heroism, and the human condition, solidifying its place as a landmark in science fiction filmmaking.",

Being a fan of the slow build of the books I was absolutely blown away by Dune: Part One.The second one, to mee, had lost a bit of the magic the first entry had.The movie is a visual masterpiece, with every scene being a visual feast.The thing I didnt care for too much was the writing, and the changes to the plot and characters. The movie spends a lot of time on a romance that everybody knows is coming, and to me they dont sell it at all.They change a few timeline things, shorten the timeline in the movie compared to the book. They also change some seemingly minor things, like who kills Vladimir, which I find to be a shame as how it was in the book I though was really cool while also being very \"dune\".All in all this is a great cinema movie! The visuals and the soundtrack really deserves the big screen.For the rest of the film I think Dune: Part Two is less faithful to the book than the first, which to me was a shame as I really enjoyed how well they adapted part one. Still, a 7/10 is pretty damn good!",

I think there are some great actors here, the story is good but I still wanted to see more, 7/10 because I respect the work that has gone into this film. For me personally it didn't live up to my expectations, my partner enjoyed it.I thought there would have a been more on offer with it being almost 3 hours long, I am glad I watched it, but I couldn't sit through it again any time soon.If you have read the book I think you will appreciate Dune 1&2 a lot more.",

In this version we can clearly see the horrors to come, since no greater disgrace can befall a people than to be ruled by a hero. And unlike the rather childish image of the Kwisatz Haderach producing the miracle of rain, we see starships going to holy war, ready to kill billions in the name of their Messiah.

Honestly I don't know how to better describe the overall experience of seeing Denis Villeneuve's visually sumptuous vision of Frank Herbert's novel. It is a meal of empty calories.I could get into dissecting this for days, but why do that? Go see it for yourself and experience it. Then go home and watch David Lynch's 1984 version and feel even more confused, amused and downrightight satisfied with such unforgettableble momentsts like Sir Patrick Stewart with a mullet, the most terrifying over the top menacing floating fat man imaginable, a creepy Reverend Mother played by a 4 year old, an amazinging sound score, and yes... the holy grail...

    "Review Content": "Dune is a mesmerizing universe unlike any I have seen. If you watched part 2, then you probably enjoyed part1. However, it's difficult to say one is better than the other because they are two very different films. That is natural, of course, for any epic franchise as the story progresses. With that being said, the first and second half of part 2 also feel like two different films. I felt like it started out slow and then was rushed at times.The first half takes us through Paul and Lady Jessica's acclimation into the Fremen. Paul transitions seamlessly, confirming the beliefs held by some that he is in fact the messiah. I understand the necessity of this especially as far as building up the following for the Lisan Al Giab. But it felt like some of this could have been cut down and more energy put into the second half. I did enjoy meeting the emperor and princess Irulan and learning more about the influence of the Bene Gesserit.The second half of the film has a different tone. Lord Baron may be the antagonist but one of my favorite aspects of this film is getting to delve deeper into House Harkonnen. We are introduced to Feyd-Rautha, who may be one of the greatest villains in cinematic history. I felt like this arc should have been explored more than some of the others. Paul's transformation to what may be Kwisatz Haderach is bewitching and is worthy of a 10 star review on its own. I would have liked to see more of the Bene Gesserit and Lady Jessica being a badass, which is one of the reasons I loved part 1 so much. Even though the film is nearly three hours long, I'd like to see an extended version of the second half.",

The music score by Lord Hans Zimmer was phenomenal, especially in the climax, and with the visual by Greig Fraser, he truly captivates the whole beauty of the Dune in such a colossal way that each frame is just mesmerizing and leaves you in awe, especially the world of Giedi Prime. The moment I saw that Harkonnen arena, it made me feel eerie and created a fear in me. The only problem for me was some fast paced scenes when they reached the south for water of life.Clearly, watching it in IMAX surely escalates the experience for me, which makes it one of my most memorable movie going experiences.Lead them to paradise.",

    "Review Content": "The long-awaited sequel to Villeneuve's interpretation of Dune offers moviegoers outstanding cinematography, costumes and set designs. For an action-heavy movie, however, the film weakens in the choreography of the fights, where punches theatrically go nowhere and blows are thrown as if in a martial arts B-movie. But what is far more significant is the pale characterization and the sometimes outrageously banal, weak dialog (including the most pathetic declarations of love in recent film history). The movie oscillates between grandeur and patheticness. While at one point the director succeeds in staging something of philosophical greatness, the high flight repeatedly ends at low points such as the completely one-dimensional good-evil characterization. It has the absurdity of a running gag when a Harkonnen scoundrel slits the neck of an assistant who is merely correcting or warning him for the third or so time. Even sillier is the super-villain outfit worn by the terribly mad Harkonnen antagonist Feyd-Rautha during his vendetta on Arrakis - a reminder of the most banal Marvel films.",

I loved the part one , its beauty and simplicity , it made me think about the characters for days after the first watch and made me watch it again. Probably it is one movie coming close to Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. Part two gives me the feeling of watching a big circus with many awe inspiring items. Once you're out of the theatre you don't feel for the movie. Despite the 166-minute running time characters does not get enough time to develop. The romance between Paul and Chani is central theme but is so underdeveloped audience don't feel for them. You feel the movie is rushed through towards the end and ending abruptly. The film has so many grand themes, and grand visuals, that it more than justifies the price of a cinema ticket. I would give 8 star to the part one and 6 star to the part two.",

I had a lot of the same feelings with part one, but thought I would like part two better. Only I really didn't. I wanted to like it so much but I never really got on board.

Viewers still have no idea why spice is so important.3, the reduction of Stilgar to a sycophantic clown so much so I was waiting for \" of course he's the Messiah, I should know I've followed a few\".4, from point one the complete omission of Jamis wife and kids, Paul and Channey's son and most importantly Paul's sister Alia, I know she is projected from the womb but this makes the ending far harder to take.........\n5, The addition of the emperor and irilon throughout the film, irilon serves to explain issues at the start of each chapter but serves very little purpose in the source material and the emperor only really speaks at the end.6, the final 2-3 minutes should have been put on the cutting room floor that to me was totally unforgivable.7 Finally I have no issue with Zimmers score, but I have a real issue with how it was applied, FWIW I had the same issue with Oppenheimer on this, the score should be there but not obtrusive to the point of obliterating the dialogue in placesI believe that this is not the film Villeneuve wanted to make, but was under pressure to pick up the pace.....as a result it plays fast and loose with the source material to an excessive degree.My final take is very impressive but not the movie it is trumpeted as.",

The movie is unique in that fact that it really focuses on the elements of the story, while showing really well developed characters interacting with the circumstances. Denis leaves it to the audience to parse out what they think about what is happening rather then seeing it through one characters perspective who informs you on how you should feel.

Denis Villeneuve undoubtedly understands his craft, but at the same time, the film doesn't bring anything explicitly new creatively. You have to take into account that the literary source material is just great, and it's largely what makes the film good. Creatively and visually, the film doesn't bring anything truly new to the table. It doesn't create a new visual image like Star Wars or the original take on Dune. If Villeneuve, with his craft, had the artistic approach of Jodorowsky then only a memorable work would have been created. Personally, I also have reservations about the leads. Timothée Chalamet is excellent as the young Paul Atreides but for me he lacks the charisma of the leader Muad'Dib, Zendaya traditionally performs rather lacklustrely. Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha, on the other hand, impressed me.",

The first half felt like Avatar in the dessert and the second half which felt like The Matrix and The Lord of the Rings mixed in a stew with an excellent storyline. Excellent cinematography, acting and marvelous special effects. They were so good it felt just as authentic as any other moment in the film. Character development of the highest level. Moment building drove me even further to the front of my chair. Thanks to the score of Hans Zimmer my heart beat harder and faster. This could\nbe the best film from the last ten years. I take my hat of for Mr. Villeneuve.",

    "Review Content": "The movie is not boring, and the story is somewhat good, but you feel like there is something missing. I think the sequence of events isn't compatible with the story, especially the confrontation between Paul and Ved, as if there was no confrontation, although the beginning and escalation of events on both sides suggest that an interesting and enjoyable confrontation will take place, but I think that the film makers were mistaken in killing that confrontation before it happened and somehow they want to finish the movie. The story of this movie, if it was divided into two movies, I believe it would be an amazing one.",

Dune 2 is just garbage.Nothing from the lore is present in the second movie: space guild disappeared completly, no child with Chani killed by sardukars, his sister is not even born by the end of the movie; and worst of all - no link between Shai-Halud and water... NO - Paul Atreides threatens the spice with nukes...\nAlso - the important plot about the traitor in the house Atreides, completely abandoned.It would've been better if they didn't made the part 2. All the people giving it more than 5 stars probably seen another movie.My advice: go watch dune one, and then continue with the 2000 series from episode 2.",

Firstly, let me say that the score gets a 10 out of 10, As it really gives this film, the emotion and deep intrigue of the storyline. As a person who has not read the books, I was not able to guess what was going to happen next, which is in my opinion, a vital element to a truly great movie. The acting was excellent. I truly felt like I was transported to a different world.I guess we will be waiting for a few years for the follow up film, and I can only hope that it will reach the same highs as this film.Congratulations on a great film!",

Chani and Pauls on screen chemistry worked very well for me and the love story that was teased in part one is now living to its full potential. Overall i am overwhelmed by how good this movie turned out on all fronts. The one thing i missed was that some characters are rushed an were not fleshed out or seen in part one at all which now is a little odd this time around.I cannot wait to see a third installment by denis villeneuve although this part has a fitting ending and can stand up on its own in my opinion!

While staying faithful to the core of the book, Dennis makes his own path, and increases the intensity and complexity of how powerful this story is. The gripping thrill it brings to the table minute by minute as we see the second half of Herbert's vision come to life was something I could not have imagined, all the actors ARE their characters. The star studded cast only builds on top of each other, and elevate one another at the same time in unison. The directing, editing, cinematography, and overall production of this movie is the reason people go to the movies. As a sincere lover of Part One still, it does not even compare to the upgrade Part Two is. GO TO THE MOVIES NEAR YOU! Take your family and enjoy this cinematic event worth remembering!",

I don't think the story is incredibly or something we haven't seen before: a hero, usually a relative of the villain, a sad love story, armies and wars and destruction and beauty is something we've seen, maybe, too much.But Dune Part 2 is amazing precisely because it takes something we've seen many times and tells it in a stunning way.",

    "Review Content": "To be completely honest, the story at its core possesses immense potential that seems largely untapped, as the narrative feels overwhelmingly dominated by dialogues. These conversations, rather than being engaging or meaningful, often fall flat and fail to captivate. My initial impressions after experiencing Dune Part One left me optimistic, harboring expectations that the sequel would escalate in terms of action and narrative depth. However, Dune Part Two managed to subvert these expectations in a rather disappointing manner, offering even less in terms of dynamic action scenes than its predecessor. The storyline meanders through these dialogues, with much of the plot progression feeling stagnant and devoid of the thrilling moments one might anticipate from such a richly conceived universe. Except for the climactic final battle, which admittedly was executed with a degree of excellence, the rest of the film felt surprisingly monotonous and lacked the excitement and engagement that the visually stunning universe and intricate lore of Dune promise. This stark contrast between the potential of the narrative and its execution leaves a lingering sense of what could have been, had the balance between dialogue and action been more thoughtfully managed.",

    "Review Content": "Watched Dune: Part Two On Saturday and Thursday, gotta say watching it in Dolby digital and IMAX really does this movie justice on both formats, there is really no other way to see this movie! If you have the chance to watch it in either or, I highly suggest to pay the extra bucks and enjoy a good time. If not, then still go watch it in regular format, this movie deserves to be viewed in theaters to get its full magnitude scale of the world Denise has adapted from Frank Herbert's best selling novel of the same name.Going in to Spoiler territory here, so tread without rhythm so you wont attract any spoiler worms coming your way:The Movie starts off exactly where it left off in the first film, with obviously a character from the book that wasn't in the first film (Princess Irulan) starting off with a recap narration of the events in the first film, this character is played by Florence Pugh.As we see the story progress Paul and Jessica meet the rest of the Fremen and Stilgar tries to convince the leaders that they are what they have been praying for this whole time and that Paul is the Lisan Al-Gaib, the Mahdi!Paula hates that he is being seen as some type of prophet but understands that he needs to win over every Fremen to go against the emperor and the Harkonens to end this feud but fears that he may loose himself in this process, the terrible purpose that the Golden Path is taking him to, to be the Kwisatz Haderach.Jessica, played by Rebecca Ferguson who by the way did a phenomenal job portraying this character, has taken the water of life and is now set to make sure Paul follows that terrible purpose he is trying so hard to avoid.Chani along with her other Fremen comrads that live in the north dont entirely believe in the prophecy and believe its all superstition.In the end Paul Takes the water of life and embraces this terrible purpose he was so bent in trying to avoid and takes over and convinces the emperor to come meet him on Arrakis and he takes over the throne and kills the Barron along with taking the art of Kanly and fight against Feyd Rautha.I give this movie a 9.5/10I will write. Better review later on, but this film stands to reveal that Frank Herberts novel CAN be adapted to the big screen and has really set a high bar for the rest of Hollywood to take and learn from as an example of exemplary film making. We are so used to seeing quantity over quality, what best superhero movie can we get out to the fans, what next disney movie can we pump out to our fans, what next \"blockbuster\" can we shoot out so people can be satisfied and they fail to realize that good quality films and story take time to be made and passion and love such as Denise Villenuve has done with Dune part one and two.",

    "Review Date": "2024-03-04",
    "Review Content": "The David Lynch version and the BBC miniseries were better. This movie tries to be epic but the timing is off. A line of underwhelming dialog accompanied by a flourish of loud music does not make it earth shaking, but that's what this movie relies on much of the time. It also spends a lot of time on ambiguous imagery or hallucinations, which in my opinion are not done well. Another gripe I have is Paul's love interest, Chani, played by Zendaya. Her behavior make no sense. At first she is the only one of the Freemen who accepts Paul, and everyone else mistrusts him. But then after everyone else finally accepts him, she becomes a hostile, difficult pain in the butt for no reason. And they give her a lot of screen time just for her hostility and antagonism. And that leads me to my final gripe over the movie, which is that they tried to impart some weakness or fragility into Paul's character. In the book and in the earlier versions, Paul is as cool as a cucumber. In this movie he loses his temper and shouts at his mother, whimpers after his girlfriend, and even gets stabbed by the Harkonen. It also ends on a cliffhanger, where a big spaceship battle is about to happen, so I guess we are all supposed to see part 3. I will definitely see it, when it is free on the internet.",

The performance that stood out for me was Butlers, I genuinely feared his character and he made me uncomfortable (of course, coupled with Villeneuves art).

Maybe that might get explored more in Dune Messiah as in Paul dealing with the aftermath of what he's done considering that book is much shorter than Dune.Maybe Messiah and children of dune will get rolled into one.My advice is don't just see it, see it on as big a screen as you possibly can!",

He knows how to do things that captivate and to make sure he gives a great experience to the audience. I speak for myself when i saw Arrival, Incendies, Blade Runner, Sciario, but the most beautiful one was Arrival and Incendies. I really advice people to start from there before watching Dune.Dune is book that is 50 years old, we had one movie only in 1984 directed by David Lynch but Star Wars came in 1977 and of course blew the charts and it was more marketing and it was already a sucess and left Dune behind and forgotten. No one ever dared to make a Dune movie again. Props to David Lynch for the courage.Never forget that Dune paved the way for Star Wars.Then we have Denis old dream to make Dune one day great again. He drew sketches when he read the books, he fell in love with the storie and wanted and dreamed that one day he would directed Dune and make justice to it.We arrived to 2021, Dune Part I for me it was beautiful and it was Denis dream come true, despite the bad critics from the box offices and the viewers he didin´t gave up and knew it was just a preparation for something huge and great. The scenarios were so realistic and choosing that Cast was a perfect choice.Now we have Dune Part II in 2024. He does not rush into things. Thank God.I´ve seen this movie yesterday and it was the best experience i have ever experienced in a movie theatre. It blew my mind every minute, every frame, every scenary and the whole storie was a blast. There are little secrets that are the key to Paul´s sudden change and thirst for revenge it blew my mind and and also Lady Jessica who i loved in part one, kind gave me a bad feelings that she is the manipulator of the whole storie, a kind of a Villan. Also a plot twist at the end left me speechless.The actors were phenonemal, the cast is the best you can have, Denis knows how to make Dune justice and great with this new generations of great actors and old actors is perfect strategy.Congrats to all behind the film and those who edited.Congradulations to Denis Villeneuve and the actors.Congradulations to everyone.Dune had it´s justice, finally.We want Dune - The Messiah.",

    "Review Content": "I wanna start out by saying this movie is an AMAZING story portrayed through the medium of film. It's a 10/10 for the sci-fi element, and it's a 10/10 for the adapted story. Unfortunately, it's probably a 5/10 for the execution, and a 7/10 for the acting.The pacing of this movie is what really disappointed me. The first movie went boom, boom, boom in order. You knew what was happening in real time, because everything was maybe a day apart at most. In this movie, some scenes feel like MONTHS apart with no explanation in between. In one scene, I legitimately went, \"Wait, what?\" because it had skipped so far ahead in the timeline. The last 45 minutes felt especially RUSHED. When I think about it now, they honestly could have put the first 1/3 of this movie at the end of the first movie, and it would made more sense. Then they could have spent more time in this movie to slow down the pace and piece the story more efficiently. So yeah, pacing was not great feature in this film.Now when it comes to the acting, I want to preface this by saying that Timothee and Zendaya are GREAT performers in general. When it came to this movie though, not a lot of depth and development. The pacing is kinda the problem here too. They're not given the time to \"fill their shoes\". You see a glimpse of character development. When do you see it, though? You guessed it. The last 45 minutes of the movie. Before then, mostly the same characters from the first movie. Nice intimate scenes with each other, but nothing of real depth and internal conflict like you would expect in a story like this. Javier Bardem, Rebecca Ferguson, and Austin Butler were amazing in this film. Lea Seydoux was an utter waste of time and not relevant to the film. Florence Pugh was kinda pointless too. Her relevance is more in important to, you guessed it, the last 45 minutes of the movie. They probably could have picked a better actress just because she doesn't really come across as someone who can portray royalty, in my opinion. I can tell she's in the limelight at the present moment, so it is what it is. Christopher Walken was not a perfect fit for the emperor, but I love him, and he deserves to be in big budget films at his age. You'll get what I mean when you watch the movie, though. Christopher Walken is CHRISTOPHER WALKEN no matter what movie you put him in.I write this just to inform people to not go into this film thinking that it is the second coming of LOTR or Star Wars. It is it's own movie, and time will tell if it will be counted among the greats. Is it a great movie? ABSOLUTELY. Is it one of the greatest? Maybe? IMDB top 100? Sure. GLORY TO THE FIGHTERS!",

    "Review Date": "2024-03-02",
    "Review Content": "Dune Part 2 missed the mark for me. While it is visually appealing, it lacks the narrative depth and intrigue present in the novel. The book presents a complex web of plots and machinations interwoven into one story; the movie is more akin to other sci fi spectacles, and leans into an action movie vibe, which tonally doesn't work with the source material. It's like it's trying to be both things at the same time, and as a result accomplishes neither.Many of the character arcs and storylines present in the novel are either heavily altered, or missing entirely. Naturally, a decent amount of this is to be expected whenever a narrative work is converted to film, but with Denis Villeneuve's Dune 2, the the changes are as numerous as they are baffling. Alia is never born in the film, and she doesn't kill the Baron. Paul does? (and the Emperor?) The introduction of Alia was perfect in book, and helps to revitalize the progression of events, keeping the story gripping and thought provoking. The movie on the other hand, spends an extortionate amount of time explaining the water of life, and exploring Jessica's new role as a Reverend Mother.In summary, Dune Part 2 is a visually appealing, narratively lacking, cinematic experience, which is refreshing when contrasted with many other recent films. Those that are new to the dune universe will likely be somewhat entertained, whereas fans of the books will probably be frustrated at the various alterations and changes.",

    "Review Content": "It has been called the best book to film transformation ever of Dune many times, and although I most certainly agree, I think there are a lot of details missing, or rather, left unexplained in the movies. The Dune films would have been best as a more large movie series, to dive further into the history, planets, people and system of the civilizations.It was only after watching video's that compare the films to the books, that you can really understand and appreciate certain details that are the result of backstories and storylines interacting with each other. One of the biggest ones, is the education system. There appears to be many roles you can study for, such as becoming a human computer, or a bene gesserit, which are all different schools that transform people completely, although this is only briefly touched upon in the movies and could easily be missed.The countless details in the movie, which have an unmentioned background: the black and white scene on the planet of Harkonnen, which is because of their moons and suns; the whole process of becoming a reverend mother and the comparison between houses; the whole house of the emperor and their planet has barely been touched. I think this is a shame and a missed oppertunity.Maybe there will be proloques to make some of this happen, or maybe it will appear in the future as a new filmed version of Dune. But, in general, I would say Villeneuve has done an incredible job, especially with the costumes and the scenery, but I believe there could still be much more, to fully explore the universe of Dune and everything it entails.",

With it his genetic memory is unlocked, he can foresee the actions of people in the future. The golden path is laid out. And so pursues the mind altering awakening, leaving him a husk; trapped in one path of fate - trapped between his own ego and the true path needed for humanity. In the movie, Paul drink bad, Paul wake up. Paul president with superpower!I understand that it's a very hard thing to portray for an audience but I think I was just really hoping for Villeneuve to emphasise the importance of that part and it felt quite rushed in that regard.But I doubt they'll make a movie about a big virgin worm so prescience might not matter too much.",

    "Review Content": "Truly, I loved the movie and I've been looking forward to it forever. Watched it 3 times on opening day. But the ending left me with a foul gut punch. I guess I'm brainwashed by hollywood movies with enjoyable endings, but this was a real bummer. Chani, despite being featured as the prominent costar, doesn't have much dialogue, gets pushed to the sidelines 3/4 in, and in the end is sadly disregarded. There was absolutely nothing enjoyable about that. Just depressing. The last 30 minutes she's just making sad faces in the background. And then Paul, after winning the fight, suddenly messages the galactic houses, out of the blue, and threatens to nuke the spice fields if they don't accept him as the emperor? How about sending an investigation to examine the validity of the situation. Instead Paul's immediate response is to start a galactic war? Seems a bit hasty yeah? Like psychotic. Isn't he supposed to be the hero? And he's doing this why? To gain power over the galaxy? Where did that come from all of a sudden? And we as the audience are supposed to applaud this? It seems a bit evil. There's just not much to be happy about at the end of this movie. A galactic jihad? Abounded lovers. It's still wonderful. But I feel poorly let down.",

The second part was disappointing for me, because they changed to much from the books, shorten the time frame of the story, to much changes on some characters and the ending... for the people that didn't read the book , it will have a different meaning - I'm curios how it will be connected with Dune Messiah (it there will be one). Also, they didn't say anything about the relationship between spice-sand worms - water on Arrakis, which is a very important part of Dune universe and by ignoring this they also had to do change (in a very bad way) one Paul's of actions in the end.",

    "Review Content": "Beautifully filmed, powerfully acted, elegantly scored and well written. As a film, Dune Part 2 almost ticks all the boxes. In my opinion, the only struggle this film suffered, was its pacing towards the middle of the film. Here, the story focuses a lot on developing Paul Atreides character, which is of course necessary, but it does so in a manner that doesn't feel structured enough, especially for those who might not have read the book. As the film nears the third act, it picks up the pace, which leads to an action packed finale with great battle sequences (that for some reason feel a bit too short).Having read the book, Villeneuve faced a very difficult task in bringing the second part of the book to life, as this is the part that is driven by character thoughts and feelings the most. Of course, some things from the book were changed or cut entirely, but I think Villeneuve did a very good job with this. Admittedly, there were a few characters or sequences that I was hoping to see, but that would've blown the already massive runtime out of proportion.All I can say is that this film needs to be seen at least a few times, especially for people who have not read the book, as the film features very abstract and complex ideas that are easily missed or misunderstood. Once those ideas and concepts are clear to the viewer, it is obvious that Villeneuve definitely did the story of Dune justice with this beautiful and at times mesmerizing film.",

I would say that this book was written to be adapted by him. True to the essence of the story from beginning until the end. From a creative standpoint all departments did a masterful job. Costumes, make up, set construction, set decoration on point from. Great editing, great sound, great music. Acting was great and i love that many of the characters were made different from the book as they feel more real, they draw you in the story. One more note on Denis creative vision. Loved all creative decision made with the story to keep it as real as possible. Tempo was great. Hats of to you and all the team! Just a wonderful experience. Made me fall in love with cinema again! Hopefully you'll stick around to adapt the other books too.",

Now, he just had to make a great sequel and that man has pulled it off!The Dune books were called \"Unadaptable\" by everyone; because of how complexed it all is. The 1984 David Lynch's \"Dune\" was good but it lacked a lot of stuff. But he is not to blame. The technology that is necessary to pull of such complexed story and visuals didn't exist back then. But it luckily is available now and Denis used it just perfectly!At first, the directing was mind blowing. Denis saw and understood what Frank Herbert wanted his audiences to picture and understand. The movie wasn't too fast, nor too slow. The first movie was a bit slow compared to this one. Everything that happened; happened for a reason. And Denis showed that beautifully. Top notch.Then we have to talk about the cast. The cast was just perfect. Their combination and chemistry was just perfect with this one. Everyone fit perfectly for the roles. Especially Timothee's facial expressions was extraordinary. And Austin's voice for Feyd Rautha was excellent. Everyone's acting was just out of this world.Now Finally, let's talk about the overall movie: It was great. The love story wasn't cringe like most of the movies we see today. Hans ZImmer just taking us to Arrakis with his score as usual. The visuals and the plot was perfect. Only reason it is not getting a 10/10 is because, some stuff happened too quickly. We all understood what happened, but Denis should've given those scenes a bit more time in order for it to be more enjoyed by the audience. But it's definitely not like the audience didn't like it. The audience absolutely loved the cinema.So I am going to say from my personal perspective; if you love Sci-fi movies, go watch part one and go watch part two in the theatres. It's worth it!",

    "Review Content": "As beautiful, as great acted and as enthralling as the first movie - no surprises there.Zendaya, Chalamet and Pugh outshines the rest of the cast, impressive when you consider the line-up. But I'm still not certain that Dune 2 outshines the first movie.Many of the things that made Dune the best movie in a decade (for me) aren't present in Dune 2 (because we have already seen it in Dune), not that it comes as a surprise. Villeneuve built a perfect world, the interpretation of the characters, their abilities, wishes and desires and the adaption of Dune to the screen was in my opinion flawless. But in Dune 2 everything is all plain to see and has already been explained. Therefore I feel Villeneuve felt a need to try to add something different, a bit of comical relief (Bardem), a familiar but not a very interesting character in the Emperor (Walken) who hardly speaks, a decision that doesn't really make sense and falls short (since he could've added the desired depth). The biggest letdown of them all was a very bland Feyd-Rautha (Butler) who is by far the worst acted character - he could've been much more interesting...I understand that Villeneuve had pressure on him to keep up the pace of the movie and most importantly build the arc of Paul but I feel he could have done much more to create the depth that Dune was so full of.Therefore I only grant this epic an 8/10 which should tell you that it still is, in spite of it's flaws, one of the best movies of a decade, but not the best ;).",

    "Review Content": "I want to preface this review by saying my favorite type of story in any show, movie or game will always be \"The chosen one\" plot.These are my thoughts on Dune Part 2 and Dune so far as a whole.Everything about this movie was everything I wanted it to be and more. I went into this movie never reading the book or looking up anything about what happens after dune part 1. There were at least 3 scenes in the first hour of the movie I kept thinking to myself \"how can it possibly get better\" and it literally just kept getting better. The acting was unreal by everybody (even Zendaya who I am personally not a big fan of, I think she's boring and doesn't have a good range of emotion in her acting) I haven't seen much of Timothee Chalamet outside of the two Dune movies but he was unbelievable in Part 2. I can't really put into words how his acting moved me besides using the word perfection. The side character casting of this movie was just as spectacular as the plot. Austin Butler (in my opinion) couldn't have done a better job at playing Feyd-Rautha. The scene with him that really stood out to me was when Paul killed Baron and the camera pans over to Feyd-Rautha and he genuinely looked like he was enjoying it with zero feeling behind his eyes while licking his lips as if he was turned on by the death of his uncle. That's the perfect depiction of evil in my opinion. Moving on to Christopher Walken, the first few lines of his I felt a little disappointed because I pictured the Emperor to be a more king like character speaking very properly and with an accent. In the final act of the movie I ended up really liking the fact that they let Christopher Walken essentially play himself. I've definitely been a Florence Pugh fan since I saw the movie Midsommer in theaters and thought the minimal lines she had in this movie were also great.The cinematography by Grieg Fraser was nothing short of beautiful. Every single wide shot of the movie had my jaw on the floor.The dialogue of this movie was probably my favorite part of the entire experience. From the funny moments to almost every line Timothee Chalamet had after waking up from drinking the water of life.After seeing so many comments about the first Dune movie on TikTok or instagram of people saying \"I fell asleep during the first movie\" or \"it was so boring\" I rewatched trying to figure out how people felt that way because the first time I watched part 1 I couldn't stop thinking about how good of an introduction to such a complex world it was. I rewatched it a 3rd time on a Friday with my girlfriend before going to see part 2 on Sunday. Part 1 was exactly what I wanted from a part 1 of any franchise. I recently rewatched all of Star Wars and LOTR a month before dune Part 2 came out to see how it would stack up against these movies and I can honestly say I liked Part 1 better than a New Hope and fellowship of the ring by a pretty big margin. The way you get so many different aspects of a story thrown at you at once was definitely a tall task but the way it was explained and showed to the audience was nearly perfect.Immediately after watching Part 2 I thought to myself wow that movie was so good it made Part 1 look bad. But as I digested the movie the next day it gave me an even bigger appreciation for the first one and how well it set up the second movie.Every time I watch a movie and end up enjoying it a lot I always think to myself \"have I ever seen something like that before\" to try and curb my recency bias.The answer is no. There's truly nothing out there like Dune Part 2 and I can honestly say it was the best movie sequel, as well as the best movie I've ever seen.10/10.",

I felt immersed in the desert world and the story was very compelling, not having read the books I did not know what was coming next.It did have some violence scenes which could be disturbing for some, but being a story centered around a war it was kind of inevitable.I heard in an interview the director saying he was very fond of the books on which the movie is based on and his passion can be seen throughout the movie. It is a piece of art and I think this is how a movie should be made, with passion for the subject and not pushing an agenda on the viewer.",

The density of the film is great with beautiful shots, incredible score and sound design and some really, really epic set pieces.What it didn't deliver as good was the pacing, some story elements and mostly the characters.For the most part Dune 2 is plot/story driven rather than character driven. There was some heavy exposition in the movie and I kind of missing why some movies are torn apart or nitpicked for this, but Dune 2 isn't.Characters a bit of downgrade compared to the first movie, specially Harkonnens. Batista, Skarskgard and even Butler had very minor engagement and were mostly tools, rather than opposing force like in the first movie.Zendaya and Timothe were fine for the most part and they have some good fleshed out moments.Biggest improve I might say was Bardem and Furguson - really good arcs and fleshing them out.What I found jarring were some plot conveniences, and I know books readers will jump to say that is how is in the books, but this doesn't mean it should be translated or it was translated good on the screen. Arakis magic is dwindled down and doesn't feel unique like the first movie.Overall its good movie, well done, but it lacks often. I find comparisons to Lord of The Rings and Oppenheimer hilarious, cuz those two for example exceed in every way.Would have given it an 8/10, but that ending felt repetition of the first movie.",

    "Review Date": "2024-03-01",
    "Review Content": "Rated 62/100.The second half of Frank Herbert's (1920-86) epic novel set in 10,100 AD (102nd century).It was a novel that could not be adapted to the screen because of the technology and narrative language required. George Lucas was wise enough to water it down and pre-market it in a package that appealed to children of all ages: \"Star Wars\" (1977).Denis Villeneuve's first installment, shot 3 years earlier, was a decent 80/100 movie that largely succeeded in paralleling the main plot of the novel.In Part 2, Paul Atreides follows the path opened to him by the Bene Gesserit priestesses through centuries of meticulous artificial selection, genetic - social - racial - religious engineering and becomes the messiah king of the Fremen under the name Muad'Dib, riding giant worms to lead a jihad against the House of Harkonen and the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV.Herbert wrote a planetary engineering manual that would guide the people who, perhaps hundreds of years later, would make distant planets habitable. Does the movie do him justice? It doesn't.This (Part 2) is a slightly above average audiovisual adaptation of the pulp of that masterpiece. Even though it is the part where the knot is untied, it is far behind the first movie. It has strayed too far - and badly - from the source material. Feyd-Rautha struck me as ridiculous, not creepy. They made a monkey out of Chani's character. The final battle and duel are poorly planned. 1984's \"Dune\" is better than this.We did a rodeo on the seats during the worm riding scenes in the 4DX theater, I clung to the seat like an octopus to avoid falling :)) Watch it at home on your comfortable couch after a few months.

The fearsome Sardaukar from the first film are mere bodies to be easily vanquished now. Sandstorms capable of tearing an airship apart are this time traversed with women in oversized baskets as they ride atop of giant worms. Dialogue between Paul and Chani nearing the end of the movie is completely missing. The type where she would *know* that he is a transformed being and he has to do something bigger than the both of them.I know that I can't always get what I want, but I'll hope for some more to be included in a director's cut on 4 K Blu-Ray.",

Having watched that movie several times, I recognize the thoughtfulness of the pace for that movie, and I was not a hater of the mystery and ponderous nature of the first.This movie is completely different. It's loud, action packed, violent, and dark in a way the first only hinted at. There are things I liked more about the first, and there are many things I liked about this one.I thought the cinematic aspects were peerless, with CGI being believable in a way I haven't seen. I liked many of the changes (Alia being my favorite), but felt there were too many differences between the movie and the book for me to score this one a perfect 10.I will watch it again and I will purchase it when I can. It was a great experience and a really good film. Is it perfect? No. Is it the comprehensive Dune film? No. Was it a great time that gave me goosebumps and didn't leave me mad as a fan?

All in all I was stunned after walking out of the cinema and I'm still happy to had the chance to this Masterpiece in the cinema wich I would recommend to everyone because I think if you wach it on the TV or your Mobile phone you can't comprehend the hole scenario and can't enjoy the really massive Music...

    "Review Content": "With Bladerunner 2049 & Dune part one, Villeneuve has already reinvented the science fiction genre. Dune part two is about the rise of the Messiah and the leader of Freman. The holy war is about to begin. Everything in the cinematography and sound design indicate that something great is indeed about to happen, something divine, evil, but necessary. It is certainly evil when Astin Butler has his first scenes in black and white. The use of brown color palettes alternating with the introduction of this chilling black and white scene puts Villeneuve's cinematography back on the map.The sublime performances of Zendaya and Chalamet create a powerful loving relationship that melts viewer heart, until... Irulan (Florence Puch) is introduced as a member of the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood. Jessica (Ferguson) gives a sublime performance as the new mother of the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood.When Paul (Timothée Chalamet) sees the light after drinking the poison, the holy war begins. The performances of Chamalet, Zendaya and Austin Butler, the cinematography, sound design, Hans Zimmer, the editing, VFX and a maker who really makes this film from a deep-rooted passion, will make that Villeneuve's Dune will be known for years as a reinvented classic of the science fiction genre.",

This is coming from someone for whom Dune Part 2 was the most anticipated film of the decade and watched the first film 3 times.The positives: this film's positives for me fit the beats of everyone; visually expansive, stunning and stellar cinematography.The negatives: the plot and layout of the film is incredibly flawed.Too much happens in too little time that characters and plot points don't simmer enough to deliver a satisfactory climax or ending. As a consequence of that, Zendaya's character comes off grating and irrational and Javier's character comes off silly and jocular. Austin Butler's character is gratuitously grotesque with zero background; he looks evil and is so, no more questions. The emperor and Florence's character are non-existent but are there somehow on the screen. Jessica and Paul both have immense transformations but we don't sit with them enough through it, so no satisfactory pay-off. Jessica being a Harkonnen is said in passing and quick and she just starts talking to her baby which is a weird choice \"I hated it\".The battle is clearly the climax but it had no preamble, there was no building of stakes beforehand; Paul transforms, gives a speech, a scene for exposition of the plan lasts 20 seconds, then they move in almost with zero resistance and we're done!Remember how battles in LOTR were built up and how long they simmered raising the stakes and thrill before the first bow even fires? Zero of that happens on Dune2. The last fight was equally abrupt, Gurney kills Rabban in 5 seconds. No stakes, no pay off.I can see that fixed if the film was split it into two films; Paul's speech and transformation conclude the first film and the 2nd films is for the battle. Throughout we build the characters with backgrounds and all.",

Return of the King has finally been dethroned from its position as my favourite film ever.Dune Part 2, like Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings adapted the source material and changed a number of things, but any complaints about changes miss the blatant fact that the films bring to life one of the greatest stories ever written in a way that was entirely faithful to the spirit of the source material.The cinematography, pacing and score for the film are all phenomenal. When combined in a double feature with Part 1, the viewing experience for Dune is far and beyond anything that has been made in the last two decades.Long live the fighters!",

    "Review Content": "Let us be frankly honest here. Dune part 2 is visually astonishing piece with good touch from Hans Zimmer. But, when it comes to logic and moving the emotions, it was just mediocre film overall. It has a lot of unneccesary violence and unneccessary scenes. Plus it was kinda boring. Only CGI worms and miners battle scenes kept me awake. When it had a lot of potential of good stories and reasons, they choose to show us unneccessary violence and nonsense killings. As a huge science fiction fan, I was disappointed tbh. Who can we ask for the explanation of the dead man's sudden revival, Chani's helicopter, deathworms control etc. Most of the good science fiction movies leave at least a little bit of explanation, clue or anything. Well, perhaps I shouldnt ask why they were big fan of engaging in hand to hand combat when they had duper high technology??? You want to say because of armor shielding? Duh. As for the acting, Timothee was mediocre, Zendeya was perfect, Bardem was funny as hell. And, whenever Rececca Ferguson appeared, I wanted throw up or something. Others were not relatable or noticeable. Best movie since LOTR? Cmon. I go to cinema to be moved by emotions, not be shaked with effects.",

    "Review Content": "This is peak cinema. Villenueve is at the top of his craft and has managed to execute this masterpiece with only a handful of minor deviations from the source material, most of which were welcome. This is a labor of love from a superfan comparable to Peter Jackson's rendition of The Lord of the Rings.The casting is spot-on if you're familiar with the story, and the acting keeps an otherwise intimidatingly alien story grounded. From a technical standpoint, there are some groundbreaking visual techniques at work, and the sense of scale surpasses what we've come to expect from Villenueve. Truly a crowning achievement and a much-needed reminder of what movies are supposed to be about.",

    "Review Content": "Great views, great music, but is it really much better than older one ? For me not necessary. Although bad effects in old story but as the whole, plots given in old version were far better and were one joint unity in comparison to current hit. Film adopted to rather not demanding viewer - landscapes and music is to replace content...if you are interested in good music as background and fine views its for you. On the other hand splitting in for to parts makes it to long and to boring at least at the begginig of the film.Good play of main character and few other actors / actress, but as a whole i give just strong 7.",

Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya were soooooo good! They definitely made the movie better! And the scenes are beautiful. You really should watch this in IMAX.I was so fascinated by this movie that after watching it, I went on to read the book, which I found somewhat challenging. However, I later discovered an interactive novel platform that allowed me to revisit the story in a more immersive way (beta.ohai.bot). I'm already looking forward to the third part!",

    "Review Content": "From the first minute I felt the magic is gone. My experience with Dune Part One was a totally different one. I was diving into the mystic worlds and characters, I loved every scene and the music was brilliantly preparing me for the vastness of emotional states. Yesterday I felt I'm watching some kind of Netflix movie with the objective to entertain me but noting more. There was no music, rather sounds. The story became dumb, mainly about relationship, revenge and power. Scenes were coming out of nowhere and characters moving in and out without clear relation to the story line. Today I watched Dune Part One again to keep the great experience and I hope Part Three will rise to the level of Part One.",

That's the only way, I've never felt bass and the use of it in a film like they did in this movie. Vibrations attract worms and they used sub-bass tones so masterfully I've never in my life experienced that in a movie and so carefully thought out. There were a couple of small lules that I personally thought could have been trimmed down for time and I didn't particularly care for the way it ended. But, it most definitely props it up for a 3rd movie. Loved every minute of it.",

I'd be damned if visuals and sound won't win the Oscars.It stays mostly true to the novel. It's been a few years since I've read it but i didn't find stark differences.There's an ample scope for all the lead cast and everyone did a fantastic job. Timothee Chalamet as Paul Artreidis and Zendaya as Chani had a terrific screen presence.A must watch.At times I felt that it was an Indian Film due to the screenplay and action sequences.8.5 stars.",

    "Review Date": "2024-03-04",
    "Review Content": "First I want to address the majority of \"Ones\" I have read here:This story is an adaptation. And most complaints I have seen here can be said for the book as well.Adaptation - Good:\nCharacters ware cut completely, somewhat disappointing, but I can understand why, nothing important lostThe timeline was sped up significantly and that is also understandable.Turning all that inner monologue into actual dialogue? They did an okay job, I'm not sure if it could've been done better. Then again, I'm no screenwriter.The ending got a bit of a makeover, especially with who bites the dust and how. Honestly, it worked better than in the books. Tied up a few character's arcs nicely, a good choice for movie.The only thing that was poorly depicted and I had to explain to some who had not read the books - is the visions and predictions and how there was a lot of different paths for Paul and they are ware form bad to worse.Basically he only had a handful of lesser evils to choose, and not one choice was easy.I think that that was major miss for the story.Acting - Very Good:\nCan't fault the acting, really. Everyone played their parts well, taking in consideration I don't personally like some of the actors.Visuals and cinematography - Very Very Good:\nWhat you see in the trailer you can expect trough the whole movie, the best part from this thing!Music - What Happened?For the half of its duration this movie was musicless. It was lacking even ambient sounds.On couple occasions it got awkward sitting in the theater! You could here people breathe.It baffles me for a day now.Nolan wont let you here dialog properly because of music. And Villeneuve wants you to feel like it is an audiobook? What is going on?Everyone that gave it one and said they fell a sleep I believe them.Nothing justifies this lack of music and sound.",

    "Review Content": "It wasn't a bad movie... but I would rather have the 1.5 hours of sleep I missed. Part 1 totally blew me away so I had admittedly high expectations. Most sequels are a letdown and this one didn't disappoint in that regard. Some aspects felt forced and otherwise it just didn't have the same magic at part one. I really think part 1 is one of the great sci-fi movies right there with 2001 and Blade Runner. Just like the Lord of the rings trilogy this is going to be a situation where the first one gets watched over and over again and the sequel languishes.I just can't understand all the folks giving it a ten. Oh well.",

    "Review Content": "Dune: Part Two is a cinematic triumph, a colossal and ambitious sequel that not only meets but exceeds the expectations set by its predecessor. Denis Villeneuve's masterful direction brings Frank Herbert's rich world to life with even greater depth and spectacle. The film's narrative is gripping, weaving intricate themes of power and destiny with a deft hand, while the performances, particularly from Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya, are profoundly compelling. The visual grandeur is matched by its narrative weight, making \"Dune: Part Two\" an epic not just in scale but in emotion and significance. It's a rare sequel that enhances and expands upon the original, cementing itself as a standout piece of modern science fiction filmmaking.",

    "Review Content": "I know. Poor Stilgar. Without him, we're lost.\"\nIt's pretty much all there, minus the deplorable rave scene (thank you M. Villeneuve).A hero that is not clear if he is The One fights for freedom with the help of his tough lady guided by a truly believer of the prophecy and a quite good Oracle. That is just fine for me.From part One, for me, all Harkonnens and their minions were simply psychopaths. Not in this one. Commandants are soft, get killed by their bosses for any minor misstep (Vader?) too much afraid of their masters and you can't find a good henchman for the service of manslaughter. No doubt the Harkonnens will fall, they employ the most useless 9-5 chaps they could get.The film is, as usual, visually impressive, but also fast-paced.Unfortunately, we will have to wait some couple of years to figure out where it is heading.",
